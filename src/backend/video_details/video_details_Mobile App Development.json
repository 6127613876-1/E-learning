        "transcript": "hello everyone welcome to v2 e-sectional myself mr nitin kumar working as an assistant professor in department of computer science and engineering with the avatar college of engineering mysuru i am the course expert for mobile application development the subject code is 18 cs651 firstly i would like to thank the person who has framed this syllabus as an open elective why because the contents which are present in this particular syllabus it is completely correlated with the contents which are available in google for certification program so if we divide the syllabus so the syllabus consists of five modules out of those five modules the first two modules deals with activities and intents and the basic designs how to design the mobile application so the remaining three modules deals with how to publish an application what are the security features that you have to consider in your mobile applications while development along with that how to make use of databases and how to develop an interactive application that you're going to learn so totally five modules the contents which are present in this five modules will make the syllabus of associate android developer certification so if you are done with the contents of this five modules you can easily take up the certification examination that is provided by the google on android platform the certification name is associate android developer certification so which can be taken in two languages one is either in java or in kotlin as per your syllabus that is present in vtu so the subject is should be taught using java programming language coming to the subject my subject name is mobile application development and the code is 18cs651 so before we start with the what is development and other things firstly we should know what is mobile application what is mobile application so why because without knowing what is mobile applications so it is not possible to understand what is development so coming to this mobile application means nothing but the facebook instagram whatsapp the apps that you're going to use in your mobile such applications are called mobile applications don't feel that only the applications that you are going to use in your mobile mobile application even in your smart watches we can develop the mobile applications for smart watches we can develop the mobile application nowadays for automotive such as for example the sound system present in your car that's also in a mobile application and for example the nowadays the tv smart tv the name is android tv that will also make use of android so coming to this mobile application so it's nothing but the applications that you're going to develop for mobile devices are called mobile applications so we can divide this mobile applications into three categories the development developing the mobile application for your mobile devices is called mobile application development which can be categorized into three categories one is based on android one is completely based on android operating system android operating system it's nothing but a linux based operating system it's an open source other one is based on ios i guess you are well versed with this term ios why because ios is nothing but it is commonly used it is commonly used only in apple devices so next one is flutter these are the three ways or these are the three platforms that we have for developing the mobile applications so what is this android mobile application development means so android o mobile development means so where we are going to make use of a tool by name android studio by name android studio to develop the android application so if you develop the application by using this android studio men's so it will work only in your android devices the applications which are developed by using this android studio will be compatible only with the android devices similarly if you develop applications using ios means those application will be compatible only with the apple devices such as apple smart smartphones apple tabs so whatever the application that you are going to develop by using this ios platform which will be compatible with the apple devices so coming to this flutter so this is also called as an ibreed platform what is this hybrid platform is so whatever the applications that you're going to develop by using this flutter will be compatible both with the apple devices as well as android devices so coming to this up these are the frameworks that we are going to use android studio ios and flutter so which are all the languages why because framework is not a complete development tool framework is a tool that's it so inside the framework you have to make use of programming language to develop the applications so which are all the programming languages we need to use the programming languages that we are going to use for the android application development is java as well as kotlin so initially when i started working with this android in year 2016 it was completely java there was no kotlin at all so in 2020 this quarterly award so by 2023 google is giving a statement that they are going to completely remove this java and they are going to replace the kotlin for mobile application development but the thing is so the framework will remain the same just the change change that is happening here is only the programming language will change previously it was java now we have kotlin next down the line there might be some other user friendly programming language may arrive that we can use for the mobile application development the programming languages will keep on changing but the framework will remain the same the outcome of this subject is you must learn how to make use of this android studio don't worry about this program why because the programming languages will keep on changing but the framework will remain the same similarly with respect to ios devices the apple devices the programming language that we are going to use right now is shift the programming language that we are using is swift programming language we will use to develop the apple applications which will be compatible only with the ios devices coming to the programming language that we are going to use with respect to flutter is dart dart dart so if you develop what's the advantage of this flutter application means so whatever the application mobile application that you're going to develop using flutter will be compatible both with the ios as well as android os that's the advantage of flutter but as per your syllabus coming to confining to your syllabus these are the three ways you can develop the mobile application one this by using android other one is by using ios other one is by using flutter so if we confine your syllabus so as per your syllabus you must learn how to make use of android studio using java this is your complete syllabus the syllabus that is present in 18 cs651 deals with android studio using java programming language so why why i need to study this particular subject what's the importance what's the importance just if you understand just if you look at the global market so when i was a student so i need i i used to go to web applications i need to browse the web applications to get the required information or features but nowadays whatever the web applications are there for them the corresponding mobile app will be there in your google play store that indicates the importance of this subject so as the number of application increases the number of roles for the mobile application developer increases so if you know this mobile application development you can easily you can easily be industry ready so coming to this mobile application development how many users are there so if you consider 100 percent mobile person mobile users in world involved out of 100 71 percent users are android users 71 percent users are using android so in india if you consider this scenario in india 95 percent users are android users as i mentioned earlier there are only three flavors of mobile applications and three flavors of operating systems so android operating system and ios devices other than that we will have microsoft nokia lumia such devices and their market is very low so if you consider the world market out of 100 71 percent users are using android phones so in india especially in india 95 users are using android devices so remaining five percent of 3.2 percent belongs to apple users and remaining other like blackberry and uh by lawyers and microsoft users microsoft lumia nokia devices okay so this is the importance of this subject why because the graph is gradually growing initially in 2014 it was some presently now in india there are 1.1 billion users are there using smartphones so 1.1 billion users are using the mobile devices out of 1.1 billion users 700 700 million users are connected to internet means they are using smartphones out of 700 million users 95 percent users are based on android that's the importance of this subject why you need to learn this subject so forget it okay so i know only one programming language so just what's the importance of this subject so if you know this subject so you can survive anywhere in your in the industry why because this subject is having a huge scope though just analyze this market out of one 1.4 1.45 billion population 1.1 billion use population is using smart phones so out of those 1.1 billion 700 million phones are connected to the internet means they are using smartphones so out of 700 million 95 users are android based that's the importance of this subject that's why i conveyed thanks to the person who has framed this subject as an open elective so coming to this subject firstly i'm going to provide a brief overview on android application development why because as i mentioned earlier as i mentioned earlier so android application development so your subject completely confines towards the android application development using java so we can develop the android application in two ways one is by using java programming language other one is by using kotlin programming language as per the syllabus present so we have to use java in android studio the tool that we are going to use is android studio so firstly i'm going to brief the basic building blocks basic building blocks so of android so we have three basic building blocks in android so first one is activities first one is activities second one is intents third one is services so if you learn these three features if you learn if you are done with this basic building blocks of android you are done with your whole syllabus you are done with the whole syllabus of google associate android developer certification so i will take one by one so what is this basic building blocks we what is this activities intents and services so firstly basic building announcements so this all three together we will will make the mobile application using android there should be activities there should be intents there should be services these three put together will frame a mobile application what is this activities are so activity is nothing but a blank white sheet like this okay so it's an empty activity it's a blank white paper whatever you want you can design here i need a button i will place it i need a text to indicate my name i will place it whatever you want you can design in this blank paper such thing is called as an activity such thing is called activity so i if you are if you know about the web application so for example there might be 500 web pages 500 web pages together we call it as a website if you consider our video website there might be around thousand web pages together we call it as meet your website we do dot ac dot in similarly there might be n number of activities n number of activities together we call it as a single mobile application so please remember one thing one activity means it's nothing but a blank white sheet blank white sheet so where whatever the feature whatever the attribute whatever the widget that you want like button text box or whatever you want you are going to place inside that activity okay so such activities n number of activities together we call it as a single mobile application similarly how 500 web pages together we call it as a website so five consider 500 websites just assume 500 web pages are there in v2 website 500 web pages together we call it as a single website similarly n number of activities there might be 100 activities together we call it as a whatsapp application so if you just if you check your whatsapp application just you can uh check the scroll bar just in the navigation pane itself you can find the three option one is chart other one is message other one is status so chart itself is a separate activity status itself is a separate activity chart itself is a separate activity call itself is a separate activity just by clicking on the chat it will open the message related thing just by clicking on the status it will open the status just clicking on the call it will open the call means so you are transiting between the three activities like that android activities together call it as a single application there is no constraint that there might be any activities itself to make a single application you want a single activity we can we can call it as a single application but to serve the purpose we need more than one activity together we call it as a single mobile application just make sure that what is activity is nothing but a blank sheet blank white page where we are going to design our requirements so coming to this intent coming to this intense intents are nothing but user intentions user intentions what is that user intentions means user intentions so user intentions means just i don't know how many of you are watching this video or the users of facebook or instagram so in this facebook you will come across some news articles so if you click on that news articles it will ask the help of google chrome or opera mini browser to open that article that means so you are present in facebook application from the facebook application to complete that action you need another application by name google chrome so such kind of intentions or code as an user intentions there are two types of user intentions one is explicit other one is implicit these are the two types of intents which are present in android one is explicit other one is implicit what is this x plus it means what is this implicit means simple explicit means so if the communication is happening within the application if the communication is happening within your mobile app such intentions are called explicit intentions for example this is my whatsapp application where i have three tabs there are three steps one is chart other one is status other one is call so if i click on this call it will open the call related things which are present in your account that means you are not accessing the other application you are transiting from one activity to the this is my main activity this is my main page right this is what you're going to get when you open the whatsapp with three options chat status call so if i click on call it will open the activity the corresponding to call similarly if i click on status it will open the activity related to status means just absorb so there will be a back button if you click on this back button it will come back to the home page or main page main activity so here what i'm doing here i'm transiting between the two activities which are present inside the whatsapp application inside which application inside the whatsapp application this kind of transition is called as an explicit transition or explicit user intentions where the transition is going to happen within the application itself so what is the explicit between the two applications between the two applications for example consider your so your you have chat so i am the user i have sent one link v2 dot ac dot in so you will you will click on this message so if you click on this message your whatsapp doesn't have that feature to open its own browser so it will ask it will open a pop-up indicating whether you need to open it with google chrome other whether you need to open with opera mini so you if i select google chrome it will open the v2 website vtu dot ac dot in just observe your this is my whatsapp application from the whatsapp from the whatsapp application i am opening my google chrome this kind of intentions are called explicit intense make it simple explicit means if the transition is happening within the application means with whatever the application the time i am having i'm not transiting between the two application i'm transiting within my app for example in whatsapp how you're going to transit between the chat status and call options so implicit intents means so if you try to open a url it will ask the help of browser so it will be opened using the browser means your whatsapp application is making use of browser to complete the task such kind of intents are called implicit intents this is the second building block that we are going to use in our android application development or the term mobile application development so coming to the last building block that is nothing but services so please remember one thing with respect to services we have lot of already available services which is present in android studio just the thing is you must know how to use them you are not going to design something new just for example i need to create a database the sqlite service is already available we have sqlite just the thing is you must know how to use that sqlite in your mobile application development for example i need to create alarm application we have already have alarm service in this android studio just the thing is you must know how to use that alarm service so to create alarm application so for example i am going to use i am going to create a music player we already have a music applications which are running which are already present in the android studio just the thing is you must know how to make use of this kind of services okay that can be used in your mobile apps so this three put together will make any mobile application make it simple the syllabus is simple just the thing is what is activity whenever you're going to create a project whenever you're going to create application so it will open a blank page where you're going to design your requirements that's what we call activity so one activity will not make the mobile application n activities together we call it as a single mobile application what is intense it's nothing but user intention for example i am present in chat of whatsapp i need to go to status this kind of intentions are called explicit intents where you are going to transit within the application within the application implicit intents so for example if my friend has sent a url i will click on that url so it will ask to browser to complete the task such if that transition is happening between the application such intents are called implicit intents so next services the basic services which are required for any application development is already available in android studio just the thing is you must know how to use them that's it so whatever for example i need to create a text to speech application so which is already available text speech service is already available just you must know how to use that service what are the prerequisites what are the programming constructs that you need to use okay the function is already available just the thing is you must learn how to use them so before we start with the development make sure that so the basic requirements for using for developing android applications you must have a system with i5 r i7 configuration the device should be the device so to run the android studio the device requirement is you must have a mission with i5r i7 or greater along with that minimum 8gb ram minimum 8gb ram these are the device requirements to run android studio or to develop the mobile application so if you try with i3 processor devices with 4gb ram it's highly impossible to develop any android application the minimum requirement the minimum this is not the maximum one the minimum requirement means you must have a device with i5 plus or i5 or above processor with 8gb ram capability then only you can execute the android studio code or then only you can develop the mobile applications using the android studio the framework throughout our syllabus the framework that we are going to use is android studio and the language that we are going to use is java so the concepts that we are going to cover throughout our syllabuses activities intents and services so first two modules deals with the activities and intents so the remaining three modules deals with the services where you're going to learn how to create a database how to retrieve the data how to show share how to save the shared preferences how to publish an application how to develop an alarm like such things so you're going to learn in the remaining three modules this is the overview of the subject mobile application development with the subject code 18 cs 651 one as i mentioned earlier there are five modules present in your syllabus the subject name is mobile application development with subject code 18cs651 so coming to the module number one so you have five contents five topics that i am covering in this module are which are all the prices which are present in your syllabus the first is so introduction to what is android you are going to learn what is android what is versions why you need versions and what is android architecture that things you're going to learn in introduction to android followed by you're going to develop the first application you're going to build the first mobile application with hands-on experience next layout what is layout what is view what is the resources such things you are going to learn here how to make use of available layouts we have a wide variety of layouts which are readily available for the design purpose followed by event handling so for example i have added a button to my design so if i do some actions how that event will be handled how the actions will be recognized such things are discussed in this event handling followed by activities what's the life cycle of activity when the activity starts when the activity resumes when the activity is dead such things you're going to learn here followed by intents as i mentioned earlier in intense you are going to learn about two types of intense one as explicit other one is implicit finally so how to test our debug the mobile application this is the overview of the syllabus that is present in module number one starting with the what is android you're going to develop a simple application finally you're going to con we are going to conclude this particular module one with testing and debugging so coming to this android what is that android means why 90 percent of indians are using android mobile phones not the ios or other why in word out of 100 71 percent users are using android why because the android is an open source so even if you want to develop an application you can develop by using android studio and you can execute that application without any hurdles you don't need any high-end configuration systems or you don't want or you want to you don't want to purchase any license why because it's an open source so it it will be based on the linux kernel what is that linux kernel means so please remember one thing we have three flavors of operating systems we have three flavors of operating system one is linux kernel based that is nothing but open source linux kernel based isn't it open source one other one is windows third one is apple or ios we have three flavors of operating systems linux based windows based and ios based where the linux base is an open source that makes that's the added advantage or that makes this android studio famous so what is this android who invented this android so the android so initially the android was developed by andy rubin and team so there are four people's four members who worked on this android and developed this android studio our android application and you might be shocked why they have developed this so they have developed this for dg cameras digital cameras but it gained popularity when it was used in smartphones in year 2005 so this android is overtaken by google so from then onwards it's a product that comes under google corporation okay so that makes it's an open source that makes that's the great advantage of this android so user inter generally this android will be used in touch screens and smart devices so over 80 percent of smartphones all over the world makes use of this android operating system so please remember one thing android is not a name of mobile device android is a name of operating system which is based on the linux kernel okay so we have three flavors of operating system such as windows linux and ios out of those three flavors linux is an open source one so that will be used in the android okay initially it was developed by andy rubin and team in 2005 it was overtaken by google so from then onwards till 2022 it's a product android is the application our android studio is a product that comes under google corporation so that the applications which are developed for this android will cover watchers tvs cars so we have around 2 million android apps in google play store that shows the importance of this subject mobile application development it's not a theoretical subject it's a practical subject so where you are going to learn how to develop the mobile application the two the one framework which is which is the number one framework why because around 90 percent 95 percent of indian users are using that framework the name is android so over 2 million android applications are available in google play store this this shows the importance of this subject and highly customized devices and windows so please remember one thing the applications which are developed in android which can be easily customized there is no constraints such as for example if you want to develop an application for ios so you have to develop the application in apple device itself it's not possible to develop the application in some other device and deploy it to apple okay so such constraints are the restrictions which are not present in android devices as i mentioned earlier the main advantage why it has gained the popularity because of it is a open source one so coming to this android studio as i mentioned earlier what is android android is just an operating system what is this android studio it's nothing but it's nothing but a framework so throughout our syllabus throughout the five modules the framework that we are going to use is android studio what is this android studio it's the official android ide official android framework where by using this official android framework you can develop the android applications okay so what are the features that are provided in this android studio why it is uh it should be used for mobile application development for android os why because you can develop the application by using this android studio you can run the application you can debug and you can test and you can package the apps so these are the features which are available in this official android id and please remember one thing so just note my words so even you can develop the android application by using some platforms such as thunkable mit app inventor please remember that so where you are that's not a core android application so such applications will be developed by school students it will not serve the purpose you cannot customize such applications to develop application which can be customized you have to make use of android studio as i mentioned earlier it supports two programming languages such as java and kotlin along with the android studio please remember so in android studio there is no need if you want to see the output for example if you are executing a c program if you are executing a java so where you are going to see the output in the console similarly if you want to see the output of the application that you have developed so it will provide a feature by name virtual devices you can create create your virtual mobile device there itself and you can see the output there itself that's the advantage that's the main feature of android studio that is it provides the virtual devices you can create a virtual phone in that framework and you can observe the output there itself and you can visualize the layout for example i need to design something so the design visualization will be present here so the design layout will be presented as a feature these are the features of the framework that we are going to use on our throw out syllabus the framework that we are going to use is android studio that is an official id of android that comes under google the language that we are going to use is java so coming to the architecture so it's an important part android platform architecture what is this android platform architecture so please observe your where we have five layers five layers first layer is application layer first layer is application layer it's nothing but the applications will run in this layer for example just i will take a scenario if you consider whatsapp that comes under this first layer it's an application whatsapp is an application so there are two types of applications one is system application other one is user application whatever you are going to use whatever you are using whatsapp facebook chat or other applications such applications will come under user application system applications means for example settings have you installed anything to for settings to change the settings in your device no it's a system application for every individual phone there will be a settings that's a system application okay such kind of applications will be running on the first layer that's why we call that layer as application layer first layer is application layer where you will be having two types of application one is system application other one is user application user application means wide variety of applications you have that may be game that may be video player that may be music player that may be whatsapp facebook chat whatever that comes under user application system application mess which we which which we we have not installed which generally comes when you purchase the device such as such applications such as security manager power management settings such things are system application that's about the first layer system and user apps or you can call it as application layer so next layer number two java api framework as i mentioned earlier there are a lot of services lot of services which are readily available in the android studio that you must know how to use so your system applications will make use of those services will make use of those services such as notification manager alarm manager music player such services will be available in this java apa framework so your applications will make use of those services to complete the task so application framework layer is the layer which provides the support for the applications which are present in the application layer so it has been written using java programming language that's why we have using the term java api framework application programming interface framework so next we have the third layer where native libraries and android runtime so i don't know how many of you watching this video know about java to run the java code we will make use of java virtual machine that is nothing but jvm similarly to execute the android application to execute the mobile application we will make use of dalvik virtual machine dvm so that will be present here that support will be present for every individual application that you are going to develop the java android runtime will be provided it's nothing but dalvik virtual machine so similar to the jvm that we use in our java so native library supports will be there native library disappointments the of device drivers for example to work to work with the wi-fi connectivity have you installed anything no there should be a device driver should be installed in your device to have the connection with your wi-fi to connect to to make use of bluetooth there will be a bluetooth device device so to make use of a browser there should be webkit device driver so to make use of graphics there will be opengl such kind of drivers such kind of libraries will be returned using c and c plus plus that comes in the third layer along with the runtime runtime means it's nothing but dvm dalvik virtual machine so that's about the third layer first layer is about application second layer is about the support to the application such as various managers third layer is about the various libraries are the device drivers along with the android runtime it's nothing but dalvik course machine so next hardware abstraction layer what is this hardware abstraction layer so if you consider your device if you consider a mobile where we have camera where we have bluetooth where we have gps where we have ram where we have memory uh how those hardware parts will be utilized by your application by using this hardware abstraction layer how the ram usage will be happened in your mobile apps by using this hardware abstraction layer how your camera turns on when you click on the camera application by this hardware abstraction layer so this hardware abstraction layer is nothing but an interface between the hardware devices hardware components which are present in your mobile along with the application for example in my whatsapp i will click on camera icon it will turn on camera how based on this hardware obstruction layer camera itself is a separating component that is present in your mobile so whatsapp is application so whatsapp is present in top layer camera is is a physical component that is present in your device how it will be embedded how they are connected by using this hardware abstraction layer so finally linux kernel so this is the hard part of this four layers so what is going to do with this linux kernel it is going to perform various management such as performance management power management security management so why that's why we call this as a art part of your mobile app so if you divide these five layers first layer deals with applications so application can be categorized into two categories system applications and user application so next java api framework it's nothing but the various features of the services how your application can use those services so next native c plus plus library and android runtime c plus plus library means it's nothing but the device drivers which are required to make use of the features that are available in my phone along with the android runtime we are going to make use of dvm it's nothing but dalvik virtual machine so hardware abstraction layer as i mentioned earlier there might be wide variety of hardware components there might be different sensors or different components which will be available in your mobile how those components can be used by using this hardware abstraction layer your application can use those hardware components so the linux kernel it will be the art part of your android application so it which will perform various management such as power management memory management security management so those things will be taken control by this linux kernel this is the art part of this architecture so architecture can be divided into five layers as mentioned in this diagram so coming to versions so presently we are using android 12 as of as on 2022 the version that we are going to that we are using is android 12 so as per the syllabus as per the contents that is present in your syllabus so so firstly we started with honeycomb the version is 3.0 which was released in the year february 2011 next ice cream sandwich in october 2011 jelly bean in 12 2012. likewise we have wide variety of versions uh starting from 3.0 till 9.0 which is present in your syllabus so now we are using 12.0 okay so which is nothing but android p android r okay so what is this version sir why the key those people will keep on updating android versions so why because so if you don't update your android version means your device your smartphone or your smartwatch will not be compatible with the new application that going to emerge that's why you must update why because what are the some there might be some drawbacks or some failures or some missing features may be available in marshmallow which will be overcome by using nugget likewise they will keep on updating the android versions and unless until that reaches the saturation as of now it has not reached the saturation till the present version that we are using is android 12 so this is the api level so the minimum api level that we should now use in our devices is 28 or 29 so the minimum api level is 28 that you must have in your device while developing any application so these are the various versions the version started with anikum ice cream sandwich jelly bean kitkat lollipop marshmallow nugget oreo and pre so the presently using version is android 12 so now last with respect to this introduction this is the last topic that is what are the challenges that we will come across while developing the android applications first one is i guess you have seen new mobile up mobile phones where it is somewhat like a laptop where you can fold some mobile devices the screen orientation is big some mobile devices are screen as a screen orientation is very less so we need to your application the application that you are going to develop should accommodate this multi-screen world for example it might be a folding uh device or it may be straight or it may be horizontal it may be vertical so you cannot state that my application will work only for the devices with horizontal orientation my application will work only for the devices with four centimeter height six centimeter width such constraints you cannot find you cannot mention so your application the application that you're going to develop should fix that multi-screen world different devices with different screen orientation will appear but your application should fit that's the first challenge that appears while developing the android app development so next one getting the performance means the memory usage the power usage such thing should be considered while developing an application okay so your application should perform just i guess if you double if you open if your battery performance preferences in your devices it will show how many various applications have used your battery how consumed your battery power so such thing that thing should be considered why because i am running an application which consumes my 50 percent of battery means who is going to install your android app no one is going to use similarly keeping the code and user secure so this is the main main attribute out of out of this file that is so if someone is downloading your application someone is using your android app means they should be secure why because nowadays we are doing a transaction over our mobile phones using various uh uh applications such as phone pay google pay amazon pay okay so if the data or the transaction details are the details which are present in our mobile phone or the contact details or the multimedia details are fetched by my application means that will be a threat so please remember one thing the users the viewers who are we watching this video kindly download any mobile application for example if you are using android applications means android phones kindly download only the applications which are available in google play store so only for such application the security checks are being done for remaining application don't don't download or don't install any application directly in the form of apk file so that may help your device as well as that may get the data that is present in your device finally it should be compatible for example i am developing an application for nowaday advanced android 12 but it should be compatible with the previous version marshmallow or kitkat lollipop so you should you should not ignore the previous versions even you have to consider the previous version and you have to update the features to be compatible with the present version that's also one challenge whatever the application that you are going to develop should be compatible with the world users so finally understanding the market and the users as i mentioned earlier present the global market for mobile application is wonderful guys so 95 percent indians are using the smartphones okay so especially 95 smartphones with android operating system so this subject this subject will have a huge weightage and will be will be a great asset why because 95 percent users who are using smartphones are android based means just imagine how many applications will have all how many jobs will be created so that's the market of android applications presently in india with respect to world concerns 71 percent users are android based thank you [Music]"

        "transcript": "to become a mobile app developer there are five essential skills let's go over them one by one there are basically two ways to build mobile apps native or crossplatform with Native development we can build an app that runs only on a particular platform like iOS or Android this approach gives us full control over the capabilities of the target platform resulting in great performance and the best user experience however the downside is that if you want to build the same app for a different platform form we have to create a separate project in an entirely different language and ecosystem this means two separate projects and two sets of bugs to fix that's where crossplatform or multiplatform development comes to the rescue with crossplatform development we can reduce development Time by reusing the same code for different platforms and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug once means it's fixed across multiple platforms now for Native development we have a few options for iOS we can use Objective C which is an older language or Swift which is modern and preferred for Android we can use Java which is a traditional language or cotland which is modern and preferred for crossplatform development the option depends on the framework or toolkit we use there are several crossplatform toolkits like react native flutter cotland multiplatform Maui and a few others let's dive into each one first off we have react native which was released by Facebook in 2015 this toolkit lets you build mobile apps using JavaScript and and react which is a popular library for building web user interfaces some big names using react native include Microsoft Office scype and even Facebook itself then we have flut which is a Google product that came out in 2017 flut uses a programming language called Dart which takes the best parts of JavaScript Java and C some examples of apps built with flutter are eBay Alibaba and Google pay it's really powerful and gaining a lot of traction now let's talk about cotland multiplatform this is the newest player released by jetbrains the same company behind tools like intellig pycharm and webstorm in my opinion the best idees in the world it uses the cotlin programming language which is a modern language inspired by Java apps like McDonald's Netflix and cash app are built with cotton multiplatform finally we have Maui which stands for net multiplatform appui introduced by Microsoft Maui allows you to build native mobile and desktop apps using C and . net these days most companies prefer to use multiplatform development to reduce their costs this means we can rule out native development for now and focus on cross-platform options now which framework is the best well there is no such a thing as the best framework yes there are people out there like our Superstar highly opinionated developer Mr John Smith who swears by react native but there are others with a different opinion the reality is that neither of these Frameworks is perfect each has its own problems and quirks that you you will discover once you start building real applications Beyond YouTube tutorials and the reason for that is that they try to support two entirely different platforms at the same time so which crossplatform solution should you choose well it depends on two things first on what languages and Technologies you're familiar with for example if you're a c developer Maui might be the easier route if you know web Technologies like JavaScript and react you might want to go for react native it's an easier transition from web to mobile development the other factor is job opportunities there are often more jobs available for react native and flutter here you can see the number of open positions for different types of mobile app developers in the US now this is the current situation here and maybe different where you live maybe there are more job opportunities for a flutter developer so I recommend doing your own research rather than taking my or someone else's advice about which route to choose but realistically if you're looking for a career in Mobile development you would have to choose between react native and flutter if you have basic web development skills react native is a better route otherwise I would recommend flutter because Dart which is the programming language that flutter uses is a nicer language to work with than JavaScript it's more modern and doesn't have the quirks and weird Parts you find in JavaScript so decide between JavaScript or Dart and commit to a study plan I believe if you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can learn the essence of either of these languages in about 2 months to help you on this journey I've created a free supplementary PDF that breaks down the specific Concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned it's a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description Box by the way I have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if you're looking for structur learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a Version Control System them like git git is not a programming language it's a tool we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and GitHub which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer now git has a ton of features but you don't need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80% of the time you use 20% of git's features 1 to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running now building mobile apps often involves working with data structures and implementing complex algorithms this is where a lot of self-taught programmers struggle because they try to skip ahead and learn more and more languages and tools without learning the fundamentals of computer science data structures and algorithms are critical subjects taught to computer science students and they're often covered in Tech interviews especially at big companies like apple Google and Microsoft while you can skip this step and go to the next as someone who has had the privilege of teaching millions of people I highly recommend you not to overlook this step otherwise you're going to feel the pain later in your career so spend 1 to 2 months studying classic data structures and algorithms this will give you a strong foundation in programming and problem solving the next thing I would recommend learning which again a lot of self-taught developers Miss is design patterns design patterns are proven solutions to Common software design problems there are 23 classic design patterns documented in the book design patterns by the gang of four many of these patterns are used in Mobile Frameworks so learning them will give you a deeper understanding of object-oriented design principles and how these mobile Frameworks work under the hood now I have to tell you this book is pretty old and written in C++ honestly it's a difficult read because many of the examples in the book are dry and not quite relevant to Modern software that's why I've created a very Hands-On and pragmatic course on this topic where I use Java and modern examples found in applications we use every day you can see how design patterns are used to solve problems in modern applications whether you want to take my course or use a different resource I believe if you dedicate a few hours every day you can have a pretty solid understanding of design patterns in about 2 months all right the next thing you need to learn is a mobile framework which we talked about before for Dart you should learn flutter and for JavaScript you should learn react native assuming you have a solid background in programming you can learn either of these Frameworks in about 2 months so if you dedicated a few hours every day and follow this road map you'll have the necessary knowledge to apply for an entry-level mobile developer job in about 8 to 12 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below I'll do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos If you enjoyed this video please give it a like And subscribe

        "transcript": "most difficult to miss the fold for our in-depth reviews and camera comparisons while these videos are long and detailed and include a lot of information there is one thing that we don't generally talk too much about which is security and privacy why because previously you see it's a conversation that is boring for a picture of the Millennials I know that you'd rather be spending time on Facebook Instagram or tiptoes No and that is precisely why you should take this topic seriously is because tick tock can actually use your videos for promotional purposes without your permission don't believe me well let my friend Toriko Xfinity take over Cory the last couple days I've been getting tweets from people screenshotting a Facebook ad for tick tock where they used my tick tock video in the ad and another thing my tick tocks are all private they're all private I might profile as private nobody has seen those besides the people the millions of people I watch the video but still they're not public on the app at all and yet they're being used commercially to promote their app basically and that brings us to this video everything to be talking about why iPhones are still better than Android phones for that one strong reason privacy and security hi Rashad from mr. phone and let's get down to this very serious video which requires a yellow eye for terror to capture your attention [Music] but before I talk about at one major reason why I think that iPhone is better than Android don't forget to hit that subscribe button and the bell icon right next to it to get notified whenever we put out videos like this and more since we started talking about how everything that you share on your favorite social media app is that company's property let's talk about app permissions and how Android and iOS individually handle this okay let's take a look at how these hero systems handle giving location access to the same app in this scenario we've taken Google Maps thankfully you can switch off location access for every single application and service from the privacy settings on both Android and iOS with the simple switch of a button coming back to Google Maps though you will notice that Apple gives you three levels of location access always-on never and only while the app is in use you don't have that final grand inner setting on Android but it looks like Android here is fixing that problem as per xdh new leak so that's definitely a good thing that said an Associated Press exclusive story recently stated that Google wants to know where you goes so badly that it records your movements even when you explicitly done it not to the article further explains even with location street post some google apps automatically store time-stamped location data without asking for example Google stores a snapshot of where you are when you merely open its maps app automatic daily weather updates on Android phones pinpoint roughly where you are okay so if you're not convinced by that Associated Press exclusive story or by whatever I am saying do me a favor and turn off your location access for all your apps actually entirely on your Android smartphone after the month go to your Google account web page and check out if Google has actually accessed your location details one word of advice for all the Android users is that don't forget to read all the app permissions that you are giving to a particular app when you launch it for the very first time rendering why would you want to give a game access to your food calls or your contacts yes there are some games that actually ask for such access okay moving on from app permissions to the very stores from where you can download these apps from on an iPhone you can use the App Store and on an Android phone if you use the Play Store to download malicious apps to do that facto will actually removed close to 700,000 malicious apps from the Play Store in 2017 that's a massive number manner apps are more prevalent on Android primarily because Google doesn't have a very strong vetting process for actually making apps and putting them on the Play Store on the contrary if you have to add an app to the App Store or an Apple iPhone you have to go through some stringent checks and processes it is not the same on Android which is why the quality of apps are also better on iOS compared to Android also since it is a more open platform it is more vulnerable to cyber attacks as well yes an open source platform definitely gives you more freedom in terms of food access and access to different apps even but then for the sake of this freedom you are compromising on your privacy and security having said all that Google has been actively working very hard to improve the security of its Android operating system by introducing a little text for the police thought to be actually actively scans any app that you download for malicious content it is like a homegrown antivirus for your Android operating system have seen cases of malicious apps entering the App Store every now and then this is also probably the reason why Google is working on fuschia OS there are a lot of strong rumors about Google working on its own operating system called fuchsia and that it will not include Android in its future smartphones primarily because there is a possibility that Google is building fuchsia with security at its core which is very vital for Google at the moment in any case if you using an Android phone right now just make sure that you don't end up downloading a clone of your favorite game that's just common sense now that only differential privacy differential privacy is a concept that is spidel as far as collecting user data for user services are concerned for example Apple connects your energy usage to tell you which emoji was use the most number of times and serve you the most used emoji so that you can actually pick them soon and you know add them in a chat conversation and it does this without actually knowing your IP address or your devices ID which means that it doesn't know that it was your iPhone that was actually sending this information about emoji usage it is a slightly complex concept to explain but an article of the conversation does a good job of it we actually managed to animate this well and we shall link the article in the description below in laymen terms to explain differential privacy say you wanted to show the most popular routes people peak walking through a buck you track the notes of hundred people who regularly walk through the park and whether they walk on the park or through the pillars as you can see on this animation but instead of sharing the specific people taking each route you share the aggregate data collected over time people viewing your results might know 60 out of 100 people prefer to take a shortcut through the grass but not which 60 people essentially who will and Apple both collect your data to create the element experiences on your folds so that you can have a great user experience when you're using their phones but it does so without knowing your devices ID or your location I think this is actually probably the only security parameter where Google and Apple are almost on par what happens on an iPhone stays on your iPhone yes this tongue-in-cheek ad was plastered all across Las Vegas during CES this year yes Apple's marketing was in full swing but there is no doubt in my mind that Apple actually cares about your privacy why else would Tim Cook go against that big lease who are flouting user privacy willy-nilly in fact I will see your typical actually wrote in a Time magazine op-ed it is time to stand up for privacy in 2019 if you want an example of how much Apple cares about use of privacy and security remember that one time when applicat it correctly refused to actually unlock an iPhone for the FBI also closer to home there was a huge outcry about how some Android phones had actually included the UI dai hem flight number without user permission care for Apple's iPhones that weren't loved on using a Google account didn't have that number and this my friends is the reason why you get a peace of mind when you're using an iPhone come to the final and most important point when you're talking about security and privacy on Android or iOS is regular software security updates to talk about security updates on both these platforms let me point you to a tweet by security lab which clearly states that iOS offers better software security updates compared to Android in fact the numbers are appalling for a lot of Android phones including Samsung and much less yes Google has been sending out regular security patches but it varies from brand to brand when the update reaches your phone it gets especially movers if your phone doesn't support project travel with support for project travel which is introduced with a droid oh do it becomes easier for Google to actually push updates security or otherwise do your phone very first on iOS updates reach you on time and iOS 12 works on even iPhone 5s which was launched more than five years ago now isn't that something on the Android side of things motorola just recently started updating its three-year old Moto G 4 plus with Android or you which is not even the latest software now I may be a big fuss about software updates simple because regular software updates ensure that love phone is actually protected from security breaches tax and all phishing attacks why do you think otherwise this boob will actually work on a monthly security patch for all Android phones people wonder why more smart phone plans cannot keep regularly updating the software of the devices that they've launched there's a couple of reasons for this the first reason is that many smartphone brands and a skin on top of Android or their own flavor of what the UI and UX should look like for example something used to have TouchWiz one plus or oxygen or air Xiaomi has MIUI and various others but what are the major reasons why upgrades are not coming at a regular piece is because manufacturers are bombarding the market with a lot of phones most of these manufacturers don't have a single phone or double phone strategy over your they have a massive lineup or force that they launch every year it becomes difficult for brands themselves to keep all of their phones updated to end the video I just want to put a couple of things into perspective firstly the high price that you pay for an iPhone means that you're getting a very secure platform and secondly the freedom offered by an Android phone is inversely proportional to how secure and private it can keep user data I'm not saying that the iPhone is entirely secure and there is no way for anybody to hack or exploit iOS but it is just so much more difficult to do so when compared to Android iOS that has been built ground up with security at its core iOS makes a strong case itself for people who want to know and read more about how security is built into iOS I am actually leaking a massive ninety five page document in the description below so for an Android user my advice to you guys would be to actually keep your phone updated with the latest operating system and the latest security patches Elden and OD it comes to you operate via phone with stock Android like the pixel or Nakia if you want peace of mind and if you want a secure OS that can keep your data private and can also come close to the security and privacy that you get on iOS so what do you guys think I want you guys to discuss in the comment section below let this be civil discussion no name-calling go if the comment section that's it from the era from mr. phone see you in the next one

        "transcript": "you are watching cold fan [Music] TV the silent battle that's been going on for eight long years two different underlying philosophies two different types of users almost two different worlds one side value stability ease of use and simplicity this is Apple's IOS the other side values openness choice and customization this is Google's Android the Rivalry between these os's is also personal to a large percentage of the population who own a smartphone the most personal device of all this is part one of the two-part series on Android versus iOS in these videos we'll take an interesting look at the brief history of both Android and iOS weigh out the pros and cons of each and then we'll take a look at what conclusions we can draw is one better than the other or is that even the right question to be asking there's a lot to this story but to really understand it we have to go to the beginning by looking at the history of each operating system in context we can understand their philosophies completely let's begin in 2005 when Steve Jobs was first envisioning the iPhone either he could make a miniature version of the Mac or enlarge the iPod which was Apple's main portable product at the time into a phone Steve assigned two different teams within Apple to pursue both options the team in charge of scale down the Mac created the iPhone OS now known as iOS now software on mobile phones is like it's like baby software it's not so powerful and today we're going to show you a software breakthrough software that's at least 5 years ahead of what's on any other phone now how do we do this well we start with a strong Foundation iPhone runs OS 10 so why did Steve ultimately choose to scale down the Mac well there's two main reasons the first one Mac OS was already complete it had animations sound power management and many other things built in why would you want to reinvent the wheel when you could just optimize the software and get it to fit in a smaller package the second reason is that Steve knew the software inside and out this knowledge helped him know that optimizing software to shrink the Mac down into a phone was indeed possible such deep involvement is often rare for a modern CEO so we have to ask how exactly did Steve know the software so well as it turns out Mac OS was actually made from the remnants of a software called Next Step Next Step was developed by Steve Jobs when he was fired from Apple in 1985 as a fun side point the worldwide web was actually built on a nextstep system in 1989 by Tim Berner Lee if you want to know more you can check out a video that I did on the history of the internet in the description below in 1997 Apple bought Next Step which brought Steve Jobs back as the CEO over the years Next Step was developed further to finally become Mac OS which as we know finally became iOS so in actuality iOS didn't just fall from the sky it had a rich history all the way back from early 1986 this is one of the major reasons why iOS was so polished from the get-go Android on the other hand was a bit of an experiment upon release founded in October 2003 by Andy Ruben Rich Mina Nick Sears and Chris White Android was initially supposed to be digital camera software of course early on it was clear that this Market was way too small so the company concentrated on producing a smartphone OS that could take on Nokia Symbian and Microsoft's Windows mobile sounds good it all started when I first met Andy who was CEO of danger and I was working at team mobile we also had another friend in common and the three of us all believed that it was too difficult to get new products out to consumers in a timely fashion and we thought the missing link was not having an open platform and that's how Android got started in July 2005 Google acquired Android Incorporated for over 50 million with this Capital Android began developing prototype phones early Android prototypes were more like blackberries that is they had no touchscreen and a physical qued keyboard later prototypes were later re-engineered to support a touchscreen to compete with other announced devices such as the 2006 LG Prada and of course the iPhone and 2007 on November 5th 2007 an industry watershed moment occurred the open handset Alliance was unveiled the alliance was an effort to develop Open Standards for mobile devices it included HTC Sony Samsung Sprint T-Mobile and Chip manufacturers such as Qualcomm Google knew they couldn't do it alone the first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC dream in late 2008 although it was rather jangly and didn't seem to fit together very well heavy Gmail integration widgets and useful pull down settings menu along with almost Limitless customization set Android apart the lagginess of the HTC dream and other early Android devices when compared to the iPhone resulted in a negative perception in the minds of the average uninformed consumer it did also do some brand damage to the operating system early on since then however Android phones have changed greatly over time over the years Android became more refined less buggy and overall more polished okay so that's all well and good but some of you might want some practical quantifiable proof of this how has Android performance in comparison to the iPhone changed over time well in early 2004 14 the touch response time for a high-end Android phone was around 114 milliseconds at Best in comparison to this the iPhone 5 and 5s came in at a blistering 75 [Music] milliseconds but by the end of 2014 new Android phones had come to the market and things had changed in that short amount of time as shown by the data here the top smartphones were actually more responsive than the current iPhone at the time all right so I've been talking a lot about how Android has changed over time but what about Apple well as you would have guessed these changes weren't only limited to Android iOS has also changed a great deal over time a lot of the early limitations pertaining to options and features have been lifted iPhones are now a far cry away from having no video camera or copy and paste now there's a choice of two phone sizes a notification center low power mode and limited multitasking Android viewers May note that a lot of these things have arguably been borrowed from Android okay so with all of that history out of the way and all of that said that brings us to the present day which OS is better today looking objectively today stock iPhones still lag behind Android in terms of functionality but is this necessarily A Bad Thing do the benefits of iOS outweigh the cons or is it flipped to the other side does Android hold the key to success in its openness and choice in the next episode we'll take a look at the app environment user base pros and cons issues and features of both Android and iOS after this we'll finish off with what's in store for the future where are Android and iOS both going it's going to be a great video so stay tuned anyway this has been toogo don't forget to give this video a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe if you're new I want to thank you for watching and I'll see you again soon for another video cheers guys have a good one [Music] cold fusin it's new thinking"

        "transcript": "What are the main differences between Android and EOS mobile operating systems? In the fast-paced world of technology, the debate between Android and EOS is heating up once again. Just yesterday, many users were searching for the latest updates on these to mobile operating systems. If you are curious about which system fits your needs best, you are in the right place. Android and EOS are the two leading mobile operating systems, each with distinct characteristics in design, functionality, customization, and user experience. Let's break it down. Starting with design and user interface, EOS 26 has introduced a visual style called liquid glass. This gives icons and widgets a shimmering layered glass effect, creating a polished look. The system adjusts tones based on the wallpaper for a clean aesthetic. On the other hand, Android 16 has updated Google's material U theme to expressive material. This emphasizes personalization with adaptive fonts and dynamic colors, making Android devices feel tailorade for users. When it comes to customization, Android has traditionally offered more extensive options. Users can change fonts, widgets, themes, and even install third-party launchers. EOS, while historically more restricted, is gradually increasing its customization capabilities. However, it still maintains a more uniform environment focused on simplicity. In terms of features and functionality, EOS 26 has added multitasking and smarter artificial intelligence tools, enhancing privacy with more and device processing. It also brings new apps and revamped interfaces for messages, photos, and camera. Meanwhile, Android 16 introduces features targeted at power users, such as advanced tools, although these may not significantly impact everyday use. Both systems are pushing four smarter performance optimizations. Looking at market share, Android dominates with over 71% favored for its wide range of devices. EOS holds about 28% known for its tightly integrated ecosystem and strong privacy controls. As for use cases, Android suits users who prefer flexibility and a broad choice of devices across different price points. EOS appeals to those who value a seamless experience with strong security and regular updates. In summary, Android offers more personalization and device variety, while EOS focuses on a refined design and userfriendly interface. Both operating systems continue to evolve with new features that cater to different user preferences."
