started in 1989 at CERN by Tim burner Lee who had just invented the world's first web browser worldwide web the origin of www but he needed a publishing language to display content within it so he chose a syntax based on the standard generalized markup language which uses opening and closing tags to provide meaning to otherwise unorganized text like H for heading p for paragraph and most importantly a for anchor to link to a different web page the language underwent many changes during the initial rise of the internet and was standardized as HTML 5 in 2008 the version we know and love today modern HTML contains tags to handle a variety of different media types like video audio and canvas to draw custom graphics on the Fly the typical HTML element starts with an opening and closing tag in the middle we have content which might be text or additional HTML elements called children the opening tag may also have one or more attributes which are key value pairs that can customize the appearance or behavior of the element to build your first web page create a file named index.html this file contains a hierarchy of nodes based on the document object model or Dom a web page starts with an HTML tag and has exactly two children a head and a body the head contains things that aren't directly shown in the web page like a title or a meta tag to give the page a description but notice how The Meta element has no closing tag closing tags are generally optional when an element is fully self-contained the body contains the actual UI for the end user we might start with an H1 heading followed by a paragraph of content to add an image we use an image tag which you'll notice is self closing then Define The Source attribute as the file path to the image and you'll want to give it an ALT description to make it accessible to robots and Screen readers what makes web pages revolutionary though is their ability to link to other web pages on the information Super Highway use an anchor tag to create a link then Define the hre attribute as the web page that you want to navigate to when clicked HTML also provides structural tags like division or div which are often used to group elements together where they can be styled to represent complex UI elements like navb bars when you're happy with your code grab the full file path to the HTML file and paste it into any web browser

first part of the ultimate html and css series in this series i'm going to take you on a journey and teach you all the skills you need to build fast and beautiful websites that look great on all kinds of devices i'm assuming you know nothing about html or css i want to learn everything from scratch so in the first part of this series we're going to talk about the fundamentals of web development with html and css in the second part we'll explore the advanced concepts and in the third part we'll put everything together and build a beautiful responsive and blazingly fast website for an imaginary cloud hosting company called mashify if you want to play with this website just head over to mashify.com and see it for yourself this is what you're going to build in this series i'm ash hamadani and i've taught millions of people how to code or how to become professional software engineers through my coding school and youtube channel if you're new here be sure to subscribe as we upload new videos all the time now let's jump in and get started [Music] all right let's talk about the tools you need to take this course for the starter you need a code editor there's so many code editors out there like visual studio code or vs code sublime text adam and so on in this course i'm going to use vs code along with a few extensions for starting a web server and formatting our code you're welcome to use your favorite code editor if you know what you're doing but otherwise head over to code.visualstudio.com and download the latest version of vs code now here inside vs code we're going to install a couple of extensions so let's open the extensions panel and search for preview here's the extension we're going to install prettier code formatter with this extension we can format our code and make it pretty this is a very popular extension as you can see it's been downloaded more than 9 million times so over here you're going to have an install button just click it and you're done next we're going to install another extension called live server with this we can launch our website inside a development web server again this is a very popular extension it's been downloaded almost 8 million times now in addition to these we're going to use a browser to view and test our web pages again you can use your favorite browser but in this course i'm going to use google chrome and i encourage you to use the same browser so you can easily follow the course we're going to start our web development journey here in every section you will learn something new about web development and by the end of this course you will put all of this together to build a beautiful web page in this section we're going to talk about the fundamentals of web development you'll learn the languages and tools used in web development as well as the key concepts and vocabulary such as url http gum and so on we're also going to talk about how websites work so you will understand what exactly happens under the hood when you use your browser to visit a website you will also learn how to inspect network traffic using chrome dev tools which is a very powerful tool used by front-end developers we'll also talk about the basics of html and css and validating web pages which is something a lot of developers miss this is going to be an awesome journey so let's jump in and get started [Music] this course is your first step towards becoming a web developer so let me give you a simple roadmap to know where you are and where you should go next every website has two parts a front end and a backhand the front end is the part that you see in your browser and interact with all the visual aspects the back end is the part that powers the front end it's behind the scenes and is mainly about storing data in databases and providing it to the front end so web development jobs fall into three main categories front-end development back-end development and full-stack development which involves both front-end and back-end development front-end developers use html css and javascript to build front-ends back-end developers have different sets of tools available to them which is outside the scope of this course so let's talk about html css and javascript html is short for hypertext markup language i know it's a mouthful but basically we use html to define the building blocks of our web pages css is short for cascading stylesheet and is used for styling web pages and making them beautiful javascript is used for adding functionality to web pages let me give you an analogy think of a building a building in the real world is like a web page on the internet it has a skeleton or structure it can have pretty walls windows and tiles and it can have certain functionality for example when we press the elevator button it comes to pick us up here's a real example let's say we want to build a website like twitter for each tweet we want to have a layout like this so first we use html to define all the building blocks of this layout what are these building blocks here an image some text indicating the user's twitter handle another block of text containing the message and three icons for commenting retweeting and liking the tweet we use html to add these building blocks to our web page then we use css to give it visual effects for example with css we can make the font bold we can make our image round we can add some padding around here we can change the color of these icons and define their look when we hover over them so css is all about aesthetics or visual effects with css we can also create beautiful animations now most web pages these days are interactive they respond to our actions like clicks and scrolls this is where javascript comes in with javascript we can add functionality or behavior to our web pages for example we can like your tweet so javascript is a programming language while html and css are not meaning we cannot use them to tell computers what to do we use them to define the building blocks of our web pages and style them every webpage you have seen on our internet is built with these three languages so the better you learn and understand these languages and their features the better you will be at front-end development so your front-end development journey starts with html and css i would say if you spend three to five hours every day studying and coding you should be able to have a reasonable understanding of these two languages in about a month or a month and a half once you learn these languages then you need to learn javascript i have a separate series for learning javascript so after finishing this series you may want to enroll in that series i would say learning javascript would probably take another six weeks of your time of course you're not going to be a javascript expert in just six weeks but you will have a reasonable understanding of it and you will learn more as you work on different projects so the first three months is all about the fundamentals now building websites often include a bunch of repetitive tasks this is where front-end frameworks and libraries come in a framework or a library comes with a lot of code that we can reuse in our websites so they help us get the job done faster that's why a lot of companies these days use one of these popular frameworks like react angular or vue now technically react is not a framework it's a library but subtle distinction on site all these tools serve the same purpose they help us build applications faster now you don't need to learn all of these to get started different companies use different tools for different projects so as you move from one project to another you may want to learn about the other tools if you're starting out just focus on react because it's the most popular tool in this space once you learn react you can always learn the other tools if needed for react you would probably need one to two months again i have a comprehensive course on react more than 40 000 people have taken this course and loved it alright what's the next step version control systems we use a version control system to keep track of our project history and work collaboratively with others there are many version control systems out there like git subversion mercurial and so on but git is the most popular tool in this space and is used in more than 70 of software companies that's why you'll see it in almost every job description i would say you would probably need two weeks for learning git and again i have a comprehensive course for you so these are the essential skills that every front-end developer must have you'll see these listed on almost every job description now different jobs require other skills but these skills vary from one company to another so you can learn these additional things in the future or on the job for now just focus on these four skills or four steps remember less is more don't try to learn too many things quickly you won't learn anything you'll just waste your time alright that's your roadmap next we're going to talk about how the web works [Music] have you ever wondered how the web works in this lesson i'm going to tell you exactly what happens the moment you type the address of a website into your browser and hit enter as part of this we're going to talk about a few important concepts and terms that you need to know as a web developer so let's say we launch our browser and head over to a website like codewithmosh.com now this address that we have in the browser address bar is called a url which is short for uniform resource locator basically it's a way to locate a resource on the internet resources can be web pages also called html documents they can be images video files fonts and so on so we type the url of a website and hit enter what happens now well there are two pieces involved here the browser also called the client and the computer or computers that host our target website we refer to these as web servers or servers for short this is what we call the client server model the client requests a service the server provides the service so our browser sends a message to the server and says hey give me the home page of this website this is kind of similar to how you send your friend a text message you can think of your phone as the client sending the message and your friend's phone as the server receiving the message now back to our example this message is formatted based on a protocol called http or hypertext transfer protocol you've probably noticed it before but never know what it is in simple terms http is a language that clients and servers use to talk to each other it's not a programming language it's just a plain textual language for communicating over the internet we also have https which is http with encryption so the messages exchange between the client and the server are encrypted here is a simplified example of an http message with this message the browser tells the server what it's looking for so on the first line it says that it wants to get a page or a file called index.html using http version 1.1 index.html often represents the home page of websites on the second line we can see the host that is codewithmosh.com and on the third line we can see the language that the client can accept in this case english now don't worry about memorizing any of this all i want you to understand here is that this message is structured based on the http protocol that clients and servers understand so the server receives this message it figures out what the client is asking and then it will send a message back to the client the first message is called an http request and the second message is called an http response every data exchange using the http protocol involves two messages a request and a response now what is in the response here's a simplified example on the first line we see the version of http protocol used followed by a number which is the status code 200 means successful or okay right below that we can see the date and time of the response next we can see the type of content the server is sending back to the client in this case text html and after that we can see the html code or the html document that represents the home page of codewithmosh.com of course the actual html code is way longer now as the browser reads this html document it constructs what we call a dom or a document object model don't let this fancy name scare you this is a model that represents the object or elements in our html document what are these elements all the building blocks of our page like paragraphs of text images links and other stuff you will see this in action in the next lesson now as the browser is reading this html document that is returned from the server it discovers references to other resources in this document like images fonts and other stuff each of these resources has an address or a url so for each resource the browser sends a separate http request to the server to fetch that resource many of these http requests are set in parallel so we can see the page as quickly as possible once the browser has all the necessary resources it will render the html document rendering an html document means displaying it it's a fancy technical term we use often so in a nutshell our browser sends an http request to the server and receives an http response this http response contains an html document the browser reads that html document to construct a document object model and render the page in the next lesson i'm going to show you all of these steps in action [Music] all right let's see http requests and responses in action so open up chrome and head over to google.com now we need to access chrome dev tools this is a very powerful tool used by frontend developers so on the top we go to view developer developer tools now look at the shortcut on mac it's alt or option command and i on windows is obviously different but remember the shortcut because it's much faster to access the devtools via the keyboard so here's the dev tools the first time you see it it might appear a bit intimidating but trust me it's much easier than you think throughout the course you're going to learn more about the dev tools so here we have a few different tabs elements console sources network and so on in this demo we're going to go to the network tab so we can inspect the network traffic to and from google.com now by default devtools is docked to the bottom of the screen we can dock it to the left to the right or undock it as a separate window so over here we can dock it to the left side a lot of frontend developers like this layout so they put devtools on the left side and they have their website on the right side now in this demo i'm going to undock it as a separate window so we have more space to work with so let's undock it good now we need to refresh our website as you can see over here on match we can press command on r on windows is probably control and r alternatively we can go back to this window and press the refresh button now back to the dev tools look at all these items over here these are the http requests that are sent from our browser to google.com as you can see there are totally 45 requests and here's the amount of data transferred over the network so in this case just over 94 kilobytes now look at the first item in this list this is the first http request that chrome sent to google.com as you can see with this request the browser wanted to get a document and the status of this request is 200 which means okay over here you can see the amount of data transferred over the network for this request and the time it took to get the response now if we click on this request we can see more details about it so here on the headers tab we can see all the headers of our request and response so here are some general headers like request url request method which is get status code that is 200 we talked about it remote address this is the new make representation of google.com now down below we have response editors there are so many headers here you don't have to worry about them but as an example look at content type we talked about this in the previous lesson so the type of this response is text html below that we have the date and time of the response now if we click on the preview tab we can see a preview of the html document that is returned from the server so this is the home page of google now in this html document we have references to other resources like images fonts and so on so all these subsequent requests are sent to download those resources so right below the first request we have a request for downloading a png or an image file here's another request for getting another image we have two requests for getting two different fonts and so on now we can easily filter this list so let's click on the filter icon here by default we see all requests but we can filter by request type for example we can select doc to see requests for downloading html documents or font to see the requests that were sent to download fonts and so on next i'm going to show you how to create your first html document [Music] alright first things first here on your desktop or anywhere on your computer right click and create a new folder i'm going to call this html but we could call it anything now let's go back to vs code and open the explorer panel then we go to open folder and open the folder that we just created good now this folder is currently empty so let's add a new file here called index.html as i told you before index.html often represents the home page of websites so let's go with that now we can close the explorer panel by pressing command and b on mac or control and b on windows good now the first thing we need to do here is to tell the browser that this is an html5 document so we type a left angle bracket now look at this suggestion list the first item here is doctype or document type let's press enter or tab vs code generated this piece of code for us so with this line of code we can tell browsers that this is an html5 document this line of code here is called doctype declaration in the previous versions of html our doctype declaration was so long it was so messy but html5 solved this problem so all we have to type is doctype html and by the way html is not a case sensitive language which means it's not sensitive to uppercase and lowercase letters but conventionally speaking we type everything in lowercase except doctype this is just a convention we could type this in lowercase and that's perfectly fine so let's revert it back now right after this we need to use our html elements to define the structure of this web page the first element we're going to use is the html element so we type html and then press tab or enter once again vscode generated this piece of code for us so what we have here on the left side is called the opening tag and what we have on the right side is the closing tag so most html elements have an opening and a closing tag but there are exceptions as i'm going to show you later in this video now inside this element we're going to add additional elements now because i don't want to type everything in one line i'm going to press enter that's better now here we're going to add two elements head and body so once again we type head press tab good and then body we use the head element to give browser information about this page for example here we can use the title element to specify the title of this page that appears in the browser over here so let's type my first web page now let's save the changes by pressing command and s on mac or ctrl and s on windows good now before going any further let's right click somewhere and go to open with live server so we're going to open this page using the development server that we just installed okay all right take a look so our page is currently empty because we haven't added any elements inside this page and over here we can see the title that we just typed my first web page now look at the url or address of this page we have 127.0.0.1 this number or this ip address represents the local computer it's globally known so everybody knows 127.0.0.1 references the current computer after that we have a colon and then we have the port number on which our web server is listening so our web server is waiting for http requests on this port okay then we have a forward slash followed by the name of our file index.html now back to vs code inside the body element we're going to add elements that would appear on our page so let's say we want to display a tweet what elements do we need here an image and some text elements so we type img short for image and then press tab here's our image element now this image element is different from the other elements we have created so far can you tell the differences there are two differences here the first difference is that here we don't have a closing tag we only have an opening tag because the image element cannot have any child elements that's the reason now in the previous versions of html we used to add a forward slash here and this represents a self-closing tag but we don't have to do this in html5 so i'm going to keep the code simpler now here we have two attributes source and alt with these attributes we can supply additional information about an element so we use the source element to specify the path to our image so let's open up the explorer panel one more time by pressing command and b on mac or control and b on windows here i'm going to create a new folder called images now for this demo i'm going to use my own image which you can also download right below this video but you can use any image that you want so here's my image i'm going to drop it onto the images folder it's right here okay now let's close this window good so where is this image relative to our index.html file it's inside the images folder right so here in double quotes we type images slash mosh.jpg now vs code is suggesting this name so we can press tab to complete the code beautiful now alt is short for alternative text and we use this attribute to give the browser some text to display in case the image cannot be displayed we'll talk about this in more detail in the future so for now i'm going to delete this attribute good now after the image we're going to add a text element so we type p that is short for paragraph tab and here we can type my twitter handle so at marsh hammondi after that we're going to add another text element and here we can type the body of our tweet so i love to teach you html perfect save the changes now back in the browser our page refreshed automatically this is one of the beauties of live server so we don't have to manually refresh the page every time we make changes now look at what we have here so we have my image and right below that we have two text elements take a look unfortunately they're not very visible obviously this doesn't look like a tweet because we haven't applied css yet as i told you before we use html to define the structure or the building block of our web pages in the next lesson i'm going to show you how to apply css so our page looks kind of like a real tweet [Music] all right now let's see how we can use css to improve the look and feel of this page look at our head element currently we have a single element inside the head element that is our title element right now after the title we're going to add another element called style this is where we're going to write our css code so in between style tags we're going to write a bunch of css rules first we're going to work on this image our image is currently too big so let's make it a bit smaller back to vs code over here we're going to type img to reference our image element then we type a pair of curly braces and inside the braces we write one or more css declarations each declaration contains a property and a value so here we can set the width property to let's say 100 pixels so we type the property colon and then the value and then we terminate this line using a semicolon so we can write multiple css declarations now let's save the changes back in the browser our image looks smaller that's a lot better but look at the edges the edges are so sharp i would like to make them a bit round so they appear softer now back to our rule here we're going to set the border dash radius property to let's say 10 pixels now don't worry about memorizing any of these properties we're going to go over them several times throughout the course in this lesson i just want you to get a sense of what it's like to use css okay so save the changes now look the edges are round and look softer now let me show you a trick if we set border radius to a value that is half of the width we'll get a round image so i'm going to set this to 50 pixels and here's the result that's a lot better now our elements are stacked vertically i want the image to be pushed to the left side so let's set the float property to left this will push the image element to the left side of our text element take a look so that's a lot better but our image is so close to the text i want to add some space after the image so here we use another property called margin dash right we can set it to 10 pixels save and that's a lot better now let's make the username bold so we're going to repeat one more time this time we're going to apply a rule to our paragraph element so here we're going to set the font dash weight property to bolt take a look see what happened both our text elements are bold but what if you want to apply this style only to the username well we have to separate these two paragraph elements so i'm going to give the first paragraph element an attribute called class so class equals double quotes class is short for classification and we can use this attribute to put this element inside a different class or a different category just like the products in a supermarket in a supermarket we have products in different categories right so i'm going to put this paragraph element inside a class or inside a category called username and then i'm going to change this rule so this rule is currently applied to all paragraph elements but i want it to be applied only to paragraph elements with the username class so right after p we type dot username now we can also remove p and this rule will apply to all elements that have the username class whether there are paragraph elements or other types of elements okay now save the changes and take a look so that's a lot better this is css in action as you can see css has a different syntax or a different grammar than html throughout the rest of the course you're going to learn both these languages in detail next i'm going to show you how to format your code using prettier hey guys mosh here i just wanted to let you know that this video you've been watching is the first hour of my ultimate html and css series so after you watch this video if you want to learn more from me you can enroll in the full course which is about 13 hours long and covers everything you need to know to build professional quality websites with html and css it also includes summary notes exercises a real project a certificate of accomplish and you can add your resume and a 30-day money-back guarantee to get a refund if you are not satisfied so you have nothing to lose and a lot to learn so if you're interested i put the link in the description box [Music] one thing you need to know about browsers is that they ignore white spaces in html and css code for example i can put all these elements on a single line and everything still works let me show you so save the changes back in the browser we have the same result as before because browsers don't care how we format our code but formatting is very important when it comes to reading and maintaining code we want our code to be beautiful and perfectly formatted just like an article this is where we use the prettier plugin with prettier we can format our code in a consistent fashion this is super important when you're part of a team because different people have different ways of formatting their code but if everyone on the team uses the prettier plugin the code will be consistently formatted so let me show you how to use preview on the top we go to the view menu look at the shortcut for the command palette on mac it's shift command and p on windows it's probably shift control mp so let's bring up the command panel and here we search for format document now we press enter we get this message saying there are multiple formatters for html files select the default formatter to continue the reason we're getting this message is that vs code by default comes with a formatter for formatting html files but we have installed prettier which is a separate formatter so let's go to configure and tell vs go to use prettier to format html and css files okay now prettier formatting my code so none of those elements are on the same line this is a lot better but let me show you a trick we don't want to format our code every time we make a change so we can configure vs code to automatically format the code the moment we save the changes so on the top let's go to the code menu then preferences and settings like here search for format and save here's the setting let's enable this setting now every time we save the changes vs code automatically formats our code using prettier [Music] we talked about the dom or document object model i told you that when the browser reads the html document that is returned from the server it constructs a document object model now let me show you this document object model in action so once again we're going to use chrome dev tools the shortcut on mac is shift command and i on windows is probably shift control and i i'm not really sure so let's open up dev tools now in this lesson we're going to look at the elements tab now what we have here on the left side is our document object model so we see the same elements that we created earlier in the course we have the html element head body and so on but we have some additional elements that are injected by live server for example we have the script element and two divs don't worry about these these are purely used by live server so it automatically reloads our page now we can hover over any of these elements and you can see that element highlighted on the screen now we can click an element and on the right side we can see the styles applied to this element so look at the styles we defined for the image element with border radius and so on we can enable or disable these styles so we can disable the width property and now our image is big we can bring it back we can also change its value so we can set it to let's say 50 pixels now our image is smaller we can use the up and down arrows to change this value this is pretty handy so a lot of front-end developers use devtools to play with these styles and get the look they want once they figure out the exact styles and their values then they apply them in the code now one more thing over here we can see where these styles have been applied so in index.html on line six we can click on this link and this takes us to the exact line of code where we wrote that style now we are currently on the sources tab so we can go back to elements and inspect other elements so this is the basics of inspecting elements using devtools we're going to talk about this in more detail in the future [Music] the last thing we're going to cover in this section is validation so as we write code we may run into problems if you have a typo in our code or don't use the right syntax or grammar our web pages may not look as expected in these situations we can use a validator to identify the potential errors in our code now currently we don't have any problems on this web page it looks perfectly fine to me but let's run it by the standard html validator so we go to validator.w3.org this is a standard markup validation service we have three methods for validating our html markup we can validate by an address if our website is live on our internet but this doesn't work for us because our website is currently hosted locally in our development server so this ip address that we have over here 127.0.0.1 this is a local ip address so no one else can access our website so here we have two other methods we can validate by file upload or by direct input in this case i'm going to go with file upload so let's upload our index.html file and check so look we have one warning and two errors the warning is saying that we haven't added the lang or language attribute to the html start tag this is a common best practice because with this we can tell search engines what is the language of this webpage so they can do a better job at displaying the results this is very easy to fix so here's our html tag we're going to add the lang attribute and set it to en which is short for english now what is next we have an error saying the character encoding was not declared don't worry about this we'll talk about this in the next section so let's look at the second error it's saying that an image element must have an alt attribute so earlier we had this auth attribute i told you that we use the alt attribute to provide a description for our image so if the image cannot be displayed the alternative text will be displayed again we're going to talk about the alt attribute in more detail in the future so back to our code let's fix this error real quick here's our image tag let's add the auto attribute and for the description i'm going to say an image of mosh hammer daddy now save the changes let's re-upload the file and validate it one more time okay this time we have only a single error and that has to do with character encoding which we're going to talk about in the next section so this is all about html validation now for css we have a different validator so we go to jigsaw.w3.org css validator now you don't have to memorize this address simply go to google and search for css validator here's the first link so we have the same interface we can validate our css code using an address or by file upload or direct input now in this case we have embedded all of our css code inside our html markup but as our web pages get more complex we want to separate our css code into separate files so our code is better organized we'll talk about this in more detail in the future so for now i'm going to copy all of our css code and then go to the third tab paste it over here and validate it so we don't have any errors everything is perfect so this is all about validation validation is very important if your web pages aren't displayed as expected always start with a quick validation because this can often point you in the right direction right that brings us to the end of this section in the next section we're going to explore html in more detail [Music] we're going to continue our web development journey and explore html in more detail so in this section we're going to cover the essential html elements you need to know to build web pages you will learn all the elements used for displaying text links images lists tables as well as container and structural or semantic elements even if you know the basics of html i would still encourage you to watch this section thoroughly because a lot of people don't use these elements the right way so let's jump in and get started [Music] earlier in the course i told you that we use the head section to give browsers and search engines information about the web page so let's explore it in a bit more detail i'm going to start with a blank document now let me show you a cool trick if we type an exclamation mark and then press tab we get a basic html boilerplate which means a basic html template so on the top we have our doctype declaration below that we have our html element with the lang attribute which is a common best practice next we have our head section with a bunch of elements we're going to talk about in a second followed by the body section so this is a very basic html boiler plate now what do we have in the head section well we have a couple of metal elements for giving information about this web page the first meta element is for defining the character set what is a character set well computers don't understand characters like abc and so on they only understand numbers which are represented in the binary format zeros and ones so using a character set we can map a character to a numeric value the first character set that was designed was the ascii character set which is short for american standard code for information interchange ascii can only represent the characters in the english language so it's very limited so over here different character sets have been created to represent more characters in international languages the character said that we use most of the time these days is utf-8 which can represent almost all characters in the world so back to our code with this meta element we're defining the character set used in this html document okay now below that we have a meta element for configuring the viewport the viewport is the visible area of a web page so it is this area over here obviously on a mobile device or on a tablet our viewport is smaller but here on desktop we can change the size of the viewport by resizing the browser so now our viewport is smaller okay now back to our code with this element we're defining the initial width and zoom factor for the viewport we'll talk about this in more detail in the future for now all i want you to know is that we need this element so our web pages look good on all devices mobiles tablets and desktop computers so as a best practice every web page should have at least these two meta elements but we have additional meta elements let me show you so if you type meta in this list you can see all possible meta elements for example we have this element for defining keywords on a web page so let's select this here we can type multiple keywords like html comma css and so on in the past these keywords were heavily used for search engine optimization but these days most search engines don't put too much weight on these keywords but we can still use them to define the keywords that represent this page we have another meta element for defining a description for this page so if you type meta colon desk and then press tab or enter here we can type a description for this page what we type here will appear on google or other search engines when someone searches for a website for example if we search for apple here's what we get now look at this text what you see here comes from this element over here so this is the purpose of metal elements with this metal element we can give information about the web page alright next we're going to talk about the elements you need to know for working with text [Music] all right now let's talk about the most common elements for working with text so you learn about the p or paragraph element which we use for displaying some text so here i'm going to say i love to teach you html now sometimes we want to emphasize a part of our text let's say the html word here to do that we can wrap it inside an m or emphasis element so here i type m press tab here's the emphasis element let's hover over it and see what the tooltip says it says the m element represents stress emphasis of its content so whenever we want to emphasize some content we can wrap it inside the m element so in this case i'm going to move html inside these tags now let's save the changes here's what we get so by default browsers display emphasized content in italic but don't assume that whenever you want to display italic content you should use the m element because the purpose of the m element is to emphasize content in our html document and this helps search engines extract important content in our documents anything to do with styling should be done in css for example here we can change the default style of emphasize element and remove the italic let me show you so in the head section we add the style element and here we define a rule for emphasized content we can set the color to red and font style to normal now don't worry about memorizing any of these css properties we're going to go over them multiple times throughout the course but let's see what happens now that we apply these styles so our emphasized content is displayed in red and is no longer italic now in the past we had an element called i which was short for italic if we use this element we get the same result as before our content is displayed in italic but this element is considered deprecated because html is not meant for styling it should only be used for structuring content so don't use the i element to display content as italic okay now we have a similar element in html called strong let's hover over it and see what the tooltip says the strong element represents strong importance seriousness or urgency of its contents conceptually it's kind of similar to the emphasis element so where you should use it really depends on your context on your content now let's save the changes and see what we get so by default strong elements are displayed as bold but once again we can always change the styling now in the past we had another element called b which is short for bold so whenever we wanted to make something bold we use this element but once again this element is considered deprecated because styling should be done in css and not in html okay so don't use b or i elements now i'm going to remove this element and just add html let me show you a cool trick let's say we want to wrap this word with the m element there is a shortcut for it so on the top we go to the view menu look at the shortcut for the command palette on mac is shift command on p and on windows is probably shift ctrl np so let's select html and then bring up the command palette with this command palette we can execute commands in vs code so here i'm going to search for a command called wrap with abbreviation that is the first command in the list now we press enter and here we type the element that we want to use to wrap our selected content in this case m press enter done so i didn't have to manually create an m element and then move html inside it it's very handy so this is all about text now let's talk about headings so in html we have six heading elements h1 we have h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 so let's see what we get so heading 1 represents the most important heading and heading 6 represents the least important heading now one common mistake that i see amongst a lot of people is that they choose these headings based on their size so if they want to have a heading with this size they would just use heading 4. that is not how you're supposed to use headings because the size can always be changed with css it's a matter of styling we should use these headings to create a hierarchy so every web page should have one and only one h1 element this heading represents what this page is all about now nothing happens if you have multiple h1 elements for example i can duplicate this line and say heading 1 plus now look we have two h1 elements but this is going to confuse search engines they're not going to figure out what this page is really all about so every page should have a single h1 element so i'm going to remove this line now after we use h1 then we should use h2 we should not jump to h4 so let's say on this page we're going to have two sections one for html the other for css so my next heading should be h2 and here we can type html obviously below this heading we can have some text so i'm going to say html tutorial our next heading should be h2 so this is the css section and in this section we can have some additional text let's say css tutorial now i'm going to delete these four headings so let's take a look so we have a hierarchy on the top we have an h1 element below that we have two h2 elements now let's say in this section we're going to have two subsections there we should use h3 elements so here's our html section in this section we're going to have two h3 elements let's say code and exercise now take a look so we have a hierarchy this is how we should use these heading elements the better we can represent the structure of our document using html the better search engines can read and understand our content so that's all about text next we're going to talk about displaying special characters in html [Music] some characters are reserved in html and to display them we have to use a special notation for example let's say we want to wrap the word html with angle brackets see what's going to happen so i type a left angle bracket and a right angle bracket see what happened vs code thought we're adding an html element so it automatically generated the closing tag we don't want this so let's delete it now back in the browser look where is our html word it's not here because the browser interpreted this as an html tag this is not what we want we want to display this exactly as this so to solve this problem we're going to use html entities all these entities start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon in between these two characters we type a few characters that determine the type of the html entity so we have an entity for displaying the less than sign that is l t short for less than now let's remove this similarly we have another html entity for displaying the greater than sign so we type an ampersand gt which is short for greater than followed by a semicolon now back to the browser that's exactly what we wanted perfect another common html entity is the copyright symbol so at the end i'm going to type an ampersand copy and a semicolon now take a look here's our copyright symbol beautiful now we have so many editors in html and quite frankly you don't need to memorize any of them in fact you're not going to use 99 of them but in case you're curious let me show you the complete list so on google search for html entities and on this second link dev.w3.org you can see the complete list of news entities so as you can see there are so many entities and honestly i have never used any of them the only ones i have used are these three plus non-breaking space let me show you what that is about so i'm going to do this line and generate some dummy text so we add a paragraph element now to generate some dummy text we type lorem followed by the number of words we want to generate let's say 50. tab look this is some dummy text in latin now let's preview it in the browser so here's what we get let's imagine that the last part on the first line and the first word on the second line should be stick together here we have a line break in between these two words you want to prevent that so i'm going to copy this word now here in vs code let's bring up the search panel by pressing command and f on mac or ctrl and f on windows now we paste this word okay here it is we want to make sure that these two words are always together there is no line breaking between them so i'm going to replace this regular space with a non-breaking space which is an html entity so we type an ampersand nbsp which is short for non-breaking space followed by a semicolon now take a look so both these words are on the second line so this is all about html entities next we're going to talk about links [Music] almost every webpage on the internet has links to other pages or websites to create these links we use the anchor element so we type a that is short for anchor and then press tab now every anchor element should have an href attribute href is short for hypertext reference i know it's a mouthful it basically means a url or a link so for this demo i'm going to create a second page called about.html and then link to it over here so in the explorer panel let's add a new page called about.html now here we're going to create a basic html boilerplate remember how to do that we type an exclamation mark and then press tab that's it beautiful now back to index.html here we can use a relative or an absolute url what do you mean by that well a relative url starts from the current page so currently we are on index.html and we want to go to about.html now currently both these pages are in the same folder so we can type a relative url to about.html like this about html that's a relative url now what if about.html was in a different folder so let's add a new folder to our project called company and then move about to this folder now where is about.html relative to the current page it's inside the company folder right so here we type company slash about.html this is a relative url now let's give this link a text i'm going to say about me so we type our text inside the anchor element okay save the changes back to the browser here's our link click and we're currently on the about page which is empty beautiful now back to our homepage instead of a text we can also use an image so i'm going to delete about me and add an image element so img tab once again here we can type a relative url to our target image so i'm going to go with images mosh.jpg now save take a look obviously this image is way too big we can always use css to resize it but that aside look at the mouse icon when we hover over this image it changed to a hand to indicate that this image is clickable okay now back to our code to keep things simple i'm going to get rid of this image and get back to our text about me now let's go to the about page and add a link back to the home page so over here we're going to add an anchor element what should we type for the href attribute well currently we are inside the company folder we have to go one level up so we can access index.html right to do that we type double periods and a forward slash with this we can go one level up now at this level which is the root of our website we have the company folder the images folder and index.html so we can reference index.html and for the text we're going to say home page again this is another example of a relative url because it starts from the current page and goes somewhere else now if you're inside a deeply nested folder structure we might have to go multiple levels up so double period and a forward slash then we repeat and repeat with this we can go three levels up now as you can see urls like this kind of look messy they look hard to read in those cases we can use an absolute url so we start with a forward slash and this represents the root of our website at this level we have access to index.html so this is an absolute url okay now back to index.html here we are linking to an html document but we can also link to non-html documents like images pdfs powerpoints and so on so let's add a link to my image so for the href i'm going to say images slash mosh.jpg and for the text i'm going to say my photo save take a look so here's our second link click my image is displayed in the browser but what if i want to prompt the user to download it that's very easy we're going to add the download attribute to our anchor element so we type download press enter now this attribute doesn't have a value so we can remove the double quotes and the equal sign so we just add the attribute name now save back to the browser we go back here we have to manually refresh the page because the live server only refreshes the current page now previously we were on my image so that was the url that live server refreshed so here we refresh to get the latest changes now when i click on this link instead of seeing my image we're going to see my image getting downloaded take a look click and here's my image beautiful now we can also link to other parts of this page so let's create two sections with a lot of text so i'm going to add an h2 element and of course i missed the h1 but let's not worry about it for this h2 we're going to say html and below that we're going to add some dummy text with 200 words so paragraph lorem 200 good now right after that we're going to add another h2 for the css section with some more text okay let's save the changes take a look as you can see the css section is below default so we have to scroll down to see what we can do here is on the top we can add a link to the css section so when the user clicks on that they will immediately jump to the css section that is very easy so here's the css section first we have to give this element a unique identifier just like everyone in the real world can have a unique identifier like a driver's license or a password every element on a page can also have a unique identifier so here i'm going to set the id attribute to css or we can use a more descriptive name like section dash css the name doesn't really matter here what matters is that we're defining what is called a fragment or a place on this page now we're going to add a link to this fragment so on the top let's add another anchor element now for the href we're going to type the pound sign followed by the name of our fragment which is section css and for the text we're going to say css now back to the browser take a look i'm going to click on this we immediately jump to the css section beautiful now a lot of websites like this also have a link that helps you jump to the top of the page let's see how we can create that so after the css section i'm going to add another anchor element now for the href i'm going to use an empty fragment so we just type a pound sign without an identifier and then we say jump to top take a look so here's our link click and now we're on top of the page now let's see how we can link to external websites so let's add another anchor element to link to google now what should we type here well google.com is a different website so here we cannot use a relative url we have to use an absolute url but if you start with a forward slash we're referencing the root of our website but in this case we want to go to a different website how can we do that well we have to start with the protocol so https colon to forward slashes google.com now let's type google and test our page click we're on google beautiful now sometimes when linking to external website we want that link to open in a new browser window or a new tab let me show you how to do that so here's our anchor we set the target attribute to underline blank save now back to the homepage once again we have to manually refresh to get the latest changes okay now when i click on google you see a new tab beautiful and one last thing we can also link to emails so i'm going to add an anchor and for href i'm going to say mailto colon programming with mosh gmail.com email me save the changes now back to our page when i click on this link my mail client will open and my email address will be pre-populated take a look so click and here's my mail client so this is all about links now one last thing before we finish this lesson what is the difference between a link and a hyperlink well a link is just an address a url the location of the target page a hyperlink is the element that the user can click on to navigate to that target page that is the difference between a link and a hyperlink but quite often these terms are used interchangeably alright we're done with this lesson next we're going to talk about images [Music] all right now let's talk about embedding images in a bit more detail for this lesson i'm going to grab an image from unsplash.com which is where we can find a lot of beautiful and freely usable images so let's search for coffee there are tons of coffee pictures here i'm going to grab this picture we can download it for free now look this image comes in different sizes small medium and large for now we're going to grab this image in a small size but in the future we're going to talk about embedding images at different sizes depending on the device so on mobile devices we want to serve a smaller image and on desktop computers we want to serve a larger image for now let's not worry about these complexities we'll have a conflict section on this topic later on so let's download the small image now it says say thank you to nathan thanks nathan this is a beautiful picture you have done a great job now i'm going to drag and drop this image onto the images folder and then rename it to coffee we want to give it a descriptive name this is a small search engine optimization tip when we provide descriptive names for our images search engines can better understand and index our pages okay so here's our image now let's add an image element we set the source to images coffee.jpg now what about the alt attribute well i briefly mentioned that we use this attribute to provide textual description of the image it's not compulsory but is highly recommended for a number of reasons the first reason is to make our page accessible to visually impaired people these people use a screen reader to read the web out to them so with this alternative text we can tell them what we are showing on the page and that means we should write a good meaningful description here like a coffee mug on a table don't write something like image or image one that is pointless now the second benefit of providing an alternative text is that we help search engines read this text and understand what we're providing here and there's one more benefit if this image cannot be loaded for some reason the alternative text is shown let me show you what i mean so i'm going to add a typo here now back to the browser look the image is not loaded but we see the alternative text this can also happen if there is a network connectivity issue if the user gets disconnected they can still see the alternative text so let's remove the typo now let's talk about sizing images as i told you before we can use css to resize our images so here in the head section let's add a style element and apply a rule to our image now this rule is applied to all images on the page this is probably not something we want to do in the real world scenario in a real-world scenario we want to apply a class to this element and then define rules for that class we'll talk about this in more detail in the future so for now let's give this image a width of 200 pixels and a height of 200 pixels now there's a tiny problem in our image can you tell our image is kind of squashed here's the reason we're dealing with a rectangular image look this is a rectangular image but we're converting it to a square image now look at the shape of this coffee mug it's kind of round right like compared with what we have over here our image is vertically squashed let me show you another way to verify this we can right click on the image and then go to inspect this opens chrome devtools and selects our image in the dom now on the right side we can see the styles that we applied to this element now i'm going to disable the height property and i want you to pay close attention to the image and see how the shape changes so look now the coffee mug is more round but if i applied the height property it becomes squashed so how can we solve this problem well we have a new property in css called object fit so here we can set object fit to one of these values most of the time we use cover so the image covers its containing box what is this containing box well first let me set this to cover here we have this image element right conceptually there is a box around every element in an html document we don't see this box but the browser uses that box to figure out how the page should be displayed so here we have a box with this dimension 200x200 and in this box we're trying to insert this image right now when we set object fit to cover our image will get resized and potentially cropped so it covers the entire containing box let's verify this so save the changes and back in the browser look our coffee mug is round but if i disable the object fit property it gets squashed again so object fit is a very useful property now we can always play with all possible values over here so i'm going to select this deleted now using the up and down arrows we can go through this list and see the impact of every value now i'm not going to go over all these values and explain what they mean this is pointless you can always figure them out on your own just remember that most of the time we use cover so the image covers the entire containing box alright this is all about the images for now next we're going to talk about video and audio hey guys mosh here i just wanted

Simplilearn",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDLn5-zSQQI",duration:554,transcript:"hey everyone today's topic is learn HTML in 10 minutes but before we begin if you haven't subscribed to our Channel already make sure to subscribe to our Channel and hit the Bell icon to never miss an update let's begin first we'll go through a quick introduction to basic web architecture to understand how the internet works then we'll understand what exactly HTML is after that we'll have a look at what CSS is then we'll go through JavaScript and in the end we'll create a simple web page using HTML and CSS to gain a better understanding of the HTML tags so without further Ado let's begin now what exactly is the basic web architecture now web architecture is made up of three essential elements ments that's the website that is the front end of a web application that is visible to the user then there is the server which constitutes the back end of a web application and holds and manages all the data and finally there's the IP address that is the address assigned to a website in order to be accessible on the internet first up let's have a look at what website is so your browser starts by loading the main HTML file and then the CSS and JavaScript the user interacts with the website and is not concerned with the back end of an application now secondly we have the server once you've developed your website you'll have to host it on your server to make it accessible on the internet server along with the database contains all the data of a website and facilitates user interaction lastly there's IP address which is the third element of the web architecture now website is hosted on an IP address we put a domain name over that IP address the same way we put names over people's phone numbers when you type a domain name in the browser it will give you the server call the server will then send over the website to you next what is HTML HTML is the most widely used markup language for developing and structuring web pages on the internet it defines the structure of websites and formats these web pages es so what exactly is CSS then now CSS is a simple design language used for making web pages look more beautiful and presentable it can be attached to any HTML element to style it or even position it according to the developer's Choice then you must be wondering what exactly is Javascript now JavaScript is a powerful interpreted language targeted for web development it is used for making web pages interactive and bringing the web pages to life so now let's create your first website now HTML short for hypertext markup language is the coding standard for documents designed for web browsers consisting of a series of elements or tags and which can be used to structure a web page right so these elements can include headings paragraphs uh div containers tables and more HTML tag are nested meaning there are opening and closing tags with the content in between those tags so now let's write a simple HTML code that will help you understand the basics of the language so for this I'm using the text editor that is Visual Studio code you can go ahead and download this text editor from their official website so here I've created a simple HTML file in my vs code and I've added the initial HTML files now let me explain to you uh one by one now Doc type is not so much of a tag but it is more of an instruction now this indicates the browser that the document type to be served to the user is in fact an HTML document now this dock type instruction should always be included at the very top of your HTML page next up you have the HTML tag that is used to contain all the web pages HTML code right so it contains an opening and closing tag with contents in between them the HTML tag can also have attributes now for example there's the Lang attribute allowing you to specify the spoken language of the content of the page followed by the HTML tag there's the head tag now this is the first section of the code that contains all of the information about the web pages properties links and more it could have Pages title description additional meta tags and CSS code so here I've used the title tag and let's give a title say HTML in 10 minutes all right you can also add CSS to the Head tag by using the style tag and change the display styles of HTML elements that are being used the next section is the body tag now the body tag contains all the displayable contents of your web page including headings paragraphs div containers tables and more now the HTML header tags are used to add headings to a web page there are several types of headings available for developers to add to a web page right so first up let's have a look at them I'm going to create a simple H1 heading tag and the message I'm displaying is this is the first heading all right after this I'm going to add a paragraph tag which creates padding in the top and bottom of the element to help separate the text between each paragraph right so I'm going to add a P tag and say this is the paragraph [Music] tag after this let me add a simple h2 tag which is another heading tag and say this is the second heading now you can also add line braks which are helpful from time to time if you want to provide a single line break in your content you can do so by adding the BR tag so here let me just add one for better understanding now the HTML div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document that is used as a container for other HTML elements now these elements can include content areas sidebars page bars page headers Footers Etc this tag is used to apply styles to HTML elements that cannot be added otherwise we can also make use of the HTML image tag to add images to a web page now these images in a web page are a very common site and they can make the website look more attractive so for that we can use the image tag so let's say IMG within which I mention the source I'm adding the HTML logo so let me just mention that here and then I'm going to provide width for it and then a specific height all right so when you save the file and when you look at the browser you can see that uh the first heading is displayed then your paragraph tag is displayed followed by the second heading and then the image now uh let me show you how you can add styles for some of these uh headings and paragraph tags so here in back my first heading tag let me just say Styles and let me change the font of the content that is being displayed and I'm going to change it to Career new and for my paragraph tag let me display the content in italics so I'll say font style and make it italics so let me save this and when I look at the browser you can see that the font has changed and so has the font style here so now we've covered a few important HTML tags used to develop a web page now there are many other tags available for almost everything you'd want to add to a web page now all of these are available on the internet for you and you can use them in your website so with that we've reached the end of this video I hope you liked it do you think we missed out on anything important let us know in the comment sections below until then keep learning and stay tuned to Simply learn hi there if you like this video subscribe to the simply learn YouTube channel

#03",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUEykHfMMnc",duration:954,transcript:"hello guys welcome back I'm YF Shaquille and you are watching HTML tutorials in this video we are going to learn about basic HTML tags so let's get started all right I have opened brackets and I will go ahead and create a new file and I will name it basic tags. HTML and we'll Write the basic HTML so we have the doc type HTML opening and closing HTML tag opening and closing head tag and inside this we have the title tag we'll set the title to basic tags and we have the opening and closing body tag now let us open the live preview We Begin our journey by first creating heading tags now in HTML there are six different types of heading tags H1 H2 H3 till H6 and in most of the cases you will need H1 H2 and H3 so let's create the heading tag tags so the first example is H1 so we'll write heading H1 similarly you can create H2 tags this is like a heading having second priority so H1 having the highest priority then H2 and if you want you can also create h three tags heading H3 and similarly H4 tags H5 tags and it's six tags and if you look at the output you can see H1 tag has a bigger font and H6 heading tag is of smaller font The Heading tags are block elements that is they take up the entire width and they have a new line before and after them so if you consider H1 tag you can see it takes up the entire width similarly h h2 tag H3 tag 4 5 and six the next tag that we are going to talk about is the paragraph tag and as the name suggest it is used to create paragraphs so to create a paragraph tag we use the P character and we can write this is a sample paragraph a paragraph tag is also a block element so if we create a new paragraph This is the second par you can see it takes a new line and occupies the entire with similarly we can create create another paragraph and write some random text like so and you can see this new paragraph is taking the entire width and since it's a block element so it is starting from a new line the next tag is used to create horizontal line and it is called the HR tag so let's say we have two paragraphs and we want to create a horizontal line between the two we'll use the HR tag let me go ahead and copy this so let's say we have two paragraphs this is a sample paragraph and we have another paragraph This is the second par and we want a horizontal line so we'll create the HR tag and you can see we have a horizontal line between the two paragraphs the next tag is the line break tag or the BR tag it is used to make any content after the BR tag start from a new line so for example let's say we create a paragraph this is a sample par paragraph so you can see we have the output this is a sample paragraph now if we move this paragraph word to the next line we can see we still have the same output and this paragraph word is still at the same line now in order to move this paragraph word to the next line we use the BR tag because in HTML even if you add multiple white spaces HTML will still count them as one space so in order to make this paragraph word appear at the next line we use the BR tag and now you can see the word paragraph starts at the next line the next tag that we're going to talk about is called the code tag it is used to display code in our web page so let's say we want to display a JavaScript code in our web page so we'll write code and inside this we can write let's say console.log hello world so you can see we have this output console.log hello world and similarly we can also show another code and let's say this time we are going to write sa our name equal to YF Shaquille so you can see the code tag is not a block element so the next code that we have written V name equal to YF shail it's starts right after the first code so in order to bring the second code element that is the opening code tag the content and the closing code tag after this first code element we'll use the BR tag now you can see the first line of code and the second line of code are now in a separate line the next tag is the pre- tag or pre-formatted tag it is used to preserve the formatting of the document now as I mentioned earlier even if we create multiple spaces between two words or we give multiple new line between two words HTML will still consider them as one character for example if you create a paragraph and we write this you can see the output this is a sample sample paragraph So we have written this is a sample paragraph in three lines but you can see the output is in a single line so in order to preserve the formatting we use the preag so let me go ahead and create a pre- tag and this time if we write this is a sample paragraph now we can see the output is in three separate lines and this sample word is having multiple white spaces before it this is because the pre- tag is preserving this white spaces in the output so in order to make this sample word this one start from the very beginning of the line we have to remove the white spaces before it similarly for the word paragraph now if you look at the output we can see this is a sample paragraph the output in three lines and each starting from the very left without any white spaces before the words and and if you look at the last line you can see we have a empty line this is because the word paragraph ends at the third line but before the closing pre- tag we have this fourth line which consist of white spaces so in order to remove this fourth line we have to remove this white spaces the next tag that I want to talk about is the anchor tag or the a tag it is used to create hyperlinks in the website so for example if you want to create a link to Dy classroom from this basic tags. HTML file we can write dycl classroom.com and we can can give this anchor tag an attribute href and then we can set the HF value to https www. Dy classroom.com so you can see we have this link or the anchor tag and it is pointing at di classroom website so if we click on this it will take us to the Dy classroom website and now let us talk about the image tag or the IMG tag so in order to show image we use the image tag so in this example let me go ahead and create an image tag and this image tag takes an attribute is s RC and the value of SRC attribute is equal to path of the image file in this case I'm going to set the SRC value to Dy classroom logo so I'll past the link of dii classroom image and now if you see the output you can see the logo of Dy classroom website now an interesting thing that we can do with an anchor tag and image tag is to create a clickable image a hyperlink image that is an image which will take us to some other website or another page when clicked now if you look at this image tag it is just a simple image and nothing happens when we click on it now in order to create a hyperlink image all we have to do is create an anchor tag and inside the anchor we create an image tag and we set the HF of the anchor tag to the URL where we want to redirect in this case dycl classroom.com and we set the image Sassi to the image we want to use in this case the logo of Dy classroom so now you can see we have an image tag inside an anchor tag so this image is now clickable it is now a hyperlink image and when we click on it it will take us to dycl classroom.com like so all right guys this brings us to the end of this tutorial I hope you will find this video interesting and if you do please give this video

Page",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90kC1YLNF3U",duration:439,transcript:"hi in this video we'll be talking about the structure of an HTML page so here's an example of a simple web page we see that up in the browser tab this web page has a title it says my first web page and on the actual page we have the phrase hello now suppose we were trying to write the HTML document that creates this web page we have the text my first web page and we have the text hello now how can we tell the browser that we actually want the my first web page text to go up in the browser Tab and we want the hello text to actually appear on the page well it turns out HTML has plenty of tags that help us tell the browser where we want the text to go we have tags that can Define the structure of the HTML page so here is the skeleton for a basic HTML page and there's a lot going on here so let's let's break this down tag by tag and see what each tag is doing so here we have the dock type dock type tells the browser which version of HTML we are using so this tag says that we're using HTML 5 note that this is not an actual HTML tag this is just a comment at the top of the file telling the browser which version of HTML we're using you'll need this at the top of all of your HTML Pages next we have the HTML tag the HTML tag says that everything between the opening and closing tag is our HTML page the HTM HL tag is the container for all other tags our entire page is going to go inside of the HTML tag now we have the head tag the head tag contains important information about the document it contains metadata so metadata is data that describes data so the head is data about the actual page it's not the page itself it's just information about the page there's a few special tags we can include in here specifically we can include the title so the title tag defines the title of the web page this is data about the web page it's describing it this is the title so the title is actually displayed in the top of the web browser inside the the tab down here we have the body tag now the body tag is where the actual content for the document goes the text the images everything on your actual web page it goes inside the body tag this is where most of your HTML tags will go most of the time when you're building a web page it's going to be inside the body tag so there's a few important points to take away from this basic HTML skeleton first is that tags can go inside other tags second is that we use indenting to show the structure of the tags to show which tags are inside of which other tags and lastly the structure of an HTML document can be described as a tree you'll see what I mean by this in a second so first off we see from this basic HTML template that tags can go inside other tags we see that the head tag and the body tag are both inside the HTML tag also we see that the title tag is inside the head tag now every time we have a tag inside of another tag we indent those tags over so everything inside the HTML tag is indented you see that everything inside the head tag is indented one further this helps us see the structure of the web page it helps us see which tags are inside which other tags now we can see that with the layout of these tags the HTML page is actually laid out like a tree at the very root of the tree we have HTML we have the HTML tag now the HTML tag has two children it has two tags that are inside of it and that's the head and the body so the head and body are right next to each other on the tree now inside head we have the title of the page so title goes beneath the head now if we were to start adding things inside the body say we added an H1 tag now the H1 tag is indented over on the document and we see that the H1 tag goes below the body in the tree if we added another H1 tag then they would both be on the same level of this tree so that's what we mean by the tree structure of the HTML document so if we want this HTML document to build this example web page we're going to have to use this HTML structure so first off let's add the HTML tag to let the browser know that everything inside there is HTML but that's done enough the browser doesn't yet know that my first web page has to go in thep top and hello needs to go inside the actual page so to split those up we're going to make the head and the body tags this says hey my first web page should not be displayed on the actual page it is metadata it is information about the page whereas hello that's actually on the page that should be displayed so that's going to go in the body now furthermore inside the head we need to tell the browser what the my first web page is how does that describe the document well it is the title of the document so when we do that we make a new child a new node in this tree and that is the title this tells the web page hey my first web page should be put right there that's where it should be displayed now for the hello we can just leave that hello blank like that we need to tell the browser how to display the hello to do that we put H1 tags around it make that H1 tag and that tells the browser put hello right at the top of the web page make it nice big and bold and lastly we can't forget to add the dock type at the top we need to tell the browser this is HTML 5 this is the version of HTML that we're using so this is the basic structure of an HTML page and this is what we'll need to use from here on out let's see this in the editor so now we're back in the codehs editor and our goal here is to make a full web page with a title and a body we want the title to say my first web page and we want the actual page to say hello world so first I'm going to get rid of that sidebar and this is this is where we'll write our HTML code so let's set up the structure of our HTML page so that the browser knows where to put what text the first thing we need to do is Define the document type so the doc type is HTML now if we go over to sections we can see we have the HTML section the head section and the body section HTML says hey all of this all of this text is HTML head says this is all the metadata for the document and the body holds the actual content of the document so HTML goes right beneath doc type and inside the HTML we want both the head and the body now we want the title of our web page to be my first web page and the title is metadata the title is information about the document so we'll put the title inside the head and say my first web page so now we've set the title for the web page so if you run this we can't actually see anything show up in the content of the page because we've left the body empty but if we see the HTML in a new window we can see that the title worked we've set the title to show up in the browser as my first web page now we need to actually fill in the content of the page so to do that let's make our H1 our H1 tag that says hello world now if we see this in a new window there we go here is our first simple web page it has a title my first web page and it says hello world inside the body now it's your turn"},{video_id:"bWPMSSsVdPk",title:"Learn HTML in 12 Minutes",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk",duration:737,transcript:"I don't think this tutorial needs much of an introduction HTML is of course the language used on the internet mainly for the structure and content of websites but used in nearly every website nonetheless I'm going to be using notepad in Windows for this tutorial just to demonstrate how easily you can create an HTML document um hopefully by the end of this tutorial you'll have a good understanding of the structure of HTML you'll not be an expert but you should have um good knowledge of essentially how HTML Works um which you can then build on and progress from there so we've got a blank document here in notepad HTML is made up of tags now a tag is how HTML defines different areas and sections of the document and it's how a web browser would read and interpret the the code essentially so the first tag you need in HTML is simply the HTML tag now most tags in HTML need opening and closing so you see up here we've got the opening HTML tag simply the word HTML in between these symbols and then down here we've got the closing HTML tag which is nearly the same of course as with a forward slash put in there and that's defines a closing tag so everything in this particular HTML file will now go in between these tags so I'm going to use tab to indent the tags within it um it's good practice it makes HTML much easier to read so within the HTML tags we have two sections we have the head section so we have an opening and closing head tag and then the body which so needs an opening and closing body tag so this is simply the the basis and the basic structure of an HTML file so I'm just going to go through some vital tags and some really basic ones that you need to know to start building websites in HTML so in the head section this is where like information about the page would go in the body section this is where the actual content which is displayed to the user would go so we'll start in the head section all we really need up here for now is the title tag now this is the text displayed in a web browser title bar I'm going to just stick in there hello world for example so if we were to save this now must remember to save it as an HTML file you can just change in notepad to save us type to all files and then type. HTML simply as the the file extension so if we were to save that and then open it in a web browser we would get a blank page but it would it should say hello world in the title bar Okay so we've got a blank page but it says hello world up here in the title bar so now we want to add some content to the page so usually the first thing you would want is a title HTML has some handy heading tags we've got H1 which would create the biggest heading a heading in terms of style simply increases the font size and makes it bold so that would be opened and closed just the same as the other tags we've used so far um then after H1 you have H2 H3 H4 H5 and H6 um which get smaller each time so H6 would be the smallest heading you could have so H1 will be the main heading then you'd use H2 as a subheading for example so we're just we're just going to use one for now and stick hello world in there and I I'll keep switching to Internet Explorer so you can see the progress we're making so now we have a heading hello world obvious that's what we've just created there so after the heading you'd want some text potentially and maybe a paragraph of text so we' use the P tag P of course for paragraph This is also opened and then closed with a text inside so we could do that and if we save it refresh the page we get a paragraph of text underneath and because we're using the correct tags The Heading tag and the paragraph tag um the H1 and the P the web browser and HTML automatically set the line spacing the indent everything as we would expect to see it if you wanted another paragraph it would be a simple case of adding more P tags and then if I just do that you'll see there's another paragraph there again with with the line spacing automatically added for us so you're building an HTML web based website you may want an image um so we're going to create an image again I I'm doing all of this from scratch just so you can to hopefully help you understand exactly how it works so if I just create a new image just call it image. BMP of course it's just an empty file at the moment so we can just create an image it it of course it doesn't really matter what's in it because it's the HTML we're working with here so we've got an image we're now going to look at the tag we need to put the image into the web page so this uses the IMG tag but of course an IMG tag alone wouldn't get us much of an image the way this one works it would set properties within the tag itself so we set the the path to the the image file we use SRC for this and then it's equals and open and close quotes and within the quotes we put the path so I can just use a relative path I'm not going to go too much into how relative and absolute paths work but essentially relative path I can simply type image. BMP and since it's in the same folder as this HTML file it will work I could of course go through the full thing by typing like C colon back slash documents or whatever it is in your version of Windows Etc but there's no need since they're in the same folder if it was in kind of an image folder it would be images images. BMP if it was in a folder one level up you use dot do slash to go up a level this is when using relative file paths which is usually much easier so also in the image tag you can set things like width you would do it in the same way you could do it in pixels um you can do it in percent if you don't put those properties in then it it just displays the original size of the image so the image tag doesn't actually have a closing tag because if you think about it we we Define everything about the image within the tag itself so there's if we opened and closed the tag there there's nothing to go inside so what we do we can't just leave it like that so we it's a self closing tag we just put a forward slash at the end of the tag before like essentially closing the opening tag and that makes it open and close all at once so if we save that and go back to our web page we can see that lovely image I just created in paint so it's as simple as that to add an image to a web page using the IMG tag so I'm going to quickly go over a couple more tags that you would use on a regular basis if for example we had another sentence in this paragraph This is my first web page I hope you like it just so you can see what that looks like as you'd expect this is my first web page I hope you like it but what if we wanted that second sentence on the next line yes we could use another paragraph tag and put it in a new paragraph but that's not just the next line that's a couple of lines down if we want to do that we use the break tag for just a line break and that's simply BR now again there's nothing that could go inside of a break so this is another self closing tag now you could just do it like that that would work in HTML but that's probably a better way to do it so if we save that and have a look at the results you can see it just goes onto the next line without leaving any spaces so the final tag I'm going to show you in this tutorial probably not one you'd use loads um the HR tag now this creates a horizontal line across the page so again there's nothing that could go inside a horizontal line so itself closes um it's as simple as that it'll sort out the spacing for us hopefully and we see we get a gray line across so you could use that to separate different sections of a web page so we've created a basic HTML page just to recap we've got the HTML tags which everything else go in and then inside the HTML tag we've got the head and the body tags inside the head tag we put the title tag um which is what displays in the title bar of a web browser and inside the body tag we have the heading the paragraph the horizontal line in this case another paragraph and an image not a fantastic web page but that is the basic structure of HTML this is the kind thing you need to know to start building Advanced websites so hopefully you now understand how tags work you open them and close them um various tags self close or don't need to be closed because they have no end tag of course this web page is not on the Internet it's just on my hard drive or in your case on your hard drive no one else will be able to see it to get it online you'd have to find a web host and upload it there are free ones out there but again I'm I'm not going to cover any more than basic HTML in this tutorial so good luck in creating your first web page and I hope you can then progress to build a full website thanks for watching"},{video_id:"Yn2r0oFpAFI",title:"Semantic HTML for Improved Accessibility and SEO #html #webdesign #webdev

instead of relying solely on generic div tags we opt for semantic tags like header nav Main and footer this is called semantic HTML and here's why it matters first there are some accessibility benefits screen readers and other assistive devices can better understand the content when we use descriptive elements this ensures a more inclusive experience for all users by choosing the right tags we convey the structure and hierarchy of our page making it easier for everyone to navigate and second it helps with SEO for similar reasons search engines appreciate semantic HTML when our content is

2&quot;",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfAGGO1MGq0",duration:3827,transcript:"in this part two of HTML fundamentals we dive deeper into the world of coding from structuring your content with tags to styling elements with CSS will cover it all if you missed part one don't worry check the link in the description and cards below let's Jump Right In and level up your HTML skills one of the fundamental building blocks of the internet are hyperlinks or for short just links so links are what actually enables the internet to be a worldwide web so without links between Pages there would be no web and so let's now learn how to place links on our own web pages now we can place links into two big categories the first category is links dead point to other Pages within our own website so let's say that here in our website the code magazine we had another blog post so we could then create a link from this page to that other page right now on the other hand the other category is links that point to outside of our website so for example if I placed a link to ud.com here on this page then that of course would be a link to the outside of our website right now we do create these two types of links in the exact same way in HTML but there are still uh some kinds of particularities that we need to be aware of and so let's now actually start with the second kind of link that I was describing which point outwards of our own website so what I have here in the demo is that here at the end of uh this part so of this what is HTML section I have a link to the mdn web docs so this is basically a website where you can learn all about HTML and also CSS and JavaScript and actually I will show you this side a little bit better uh in the next section because it's important as a web developer to know how to use and find information here uh in this web documentations page so what we want is to grab the link of that and so to do that just Google mdn which stands for Mozilla developer Network and then just HTML and the exact URL that we're going to use here doesn't really matter all we want is to have some URL that points outside of our own page right so let's just grab this one here which was the first Google result so I'm copying it and again keep in mind that this is called a URL so as you know every single website on the internet has its own URL and so that is what we need in order to create a link to that page okay so let's see yeah we want to put that right here after this unordered list right let's see in the demo uh yeah so right here after the ordered list so that's here so to create a link in HTML we use the a element which stands for anchor so technically a hyperlink or a link is actually called anchor in HTML so it is an anchor element we can close it then we can specify some content and then we can or we have to actually close it so let's start by doing that now as for the content of the link what we specify here is actually the text that we want to be displayed on the page so the text of the link so in this case that is this mdn web docs all right so mdn web docs but now what about the L where we want this link to point to well for that we need to once again use an attribute so in this case it is the H ref attribute then equal double quotes and then we can simply paste that URL that we copied right here and that's actually it so if I give it a save now and then reload our page here then here is our link and you see down there so here in this corner that when I hover it it actually shows me the URL and then when I click it our page goes there great and so that is actually already the basics of creating a link very simple right now we want this uh link here to actually be like inside of this text so inside of one more paragraph here right so let's create that paragraph so you can learn more at and then this link here is basically just a continuation of the text in here so inside of this paragraph so we can finish our sentence here and then close up our paragraph as usual and so now that looks just like uh in the original one right now notice what happens here once again when I click it so you see that we navigated directly to this page and now our own page disappeared so of course we can go back here but sometimes what we want to do is to open a link in a new tab so let me also show you how we can do that and of course we don't always want that so many times we actually want the page to really move to uh the URL that we specified here but also sometimes it's useful to keep the Page open and simply open the URL in a new tab and we can do that by specifying the target attribute then the quotes as always and then this one looks a bit weird so it's underscore and then blank so give that a save and when we reload it will look the same but the behavior should have changed and indeed notice how it opened a new tab and uh or original one is still open great so that worked and so we have now a link that points to a URL that is outside of our own website but now about that first scenario where we want to link to an internal page basically let's do that now and going back again to our demo we have here this example so in the very beginning right after the main heading we have these links here and so these uh are supposed to be links that point to pages that are part of this blog so let's now create this first link here so blog and also create a new page where we can actually link too okay and so creating a new page is as simple as creating a new HTML document so let's open up again our sidebar by clicking here and then we see our Explorer here basically with all the files and then again we create a new file in this icon here and let's call it blog. HTML this time and now we could use this cheat here to create the HTML structure but actually let's practice a little bit here again and if you want you can even pause the video and type it out on your own I will just do it here very fast now so HTML then we need to close it of course now inside of the HTML remember we have uh the head inside of the head we have a title usually and this one let's just call it like this block just uppercase to make it really obvious and you see that this is really just a very Bare Bones structure just ahead with a title and actually the same for the body which remember is the part that is going to be visible uh in the browser so here I will simply specify an H2 element and close it also here and let's call this one blog as well okay ah we still need to close the body of course and that's it let's give it a save and so here we have a very simple very Bare Bones uh block HTML document but now now with that in place we can create a hyperlink or a link uh right here in this index.html which will point to that block. HTML and so the browser will then navigate to that page so let's do it right here after the H1 and so the anchor element then we need the H ref and so now what we do here instead of specifying a URL is to specify the name of the HTML file that we want to go to and so in this case it is of course this blog. HTML that we just created then here as the content of the element let's just write blog again and then close it as always give it a save here is our beautiful link and now watch what happens as I click it bam we are now at blog and you can see that also here in the URL bar so which is now all of this file and so all of this path and then at the end blog. HTML right now to go back we could of course uh click here on this back button but what we could also do is to add a link here which simply points back to index.html right that sounds like a nice idea doesn't it so let's come back here to blog. HTML and as yet another challenge now I want you to actually create this link on your own so pause the video here and create a link that points back to index.html so did you manage to do that or at least try it well I sure hope so but anyway of course we use the a element again then we specify hre and well to go back we just say index Doh HTML and then here we can specify any text which I didn't tell you which one because it doesn't really matter let's just say back to home or something like that give it a save and now once we reload it we have our link we can click it and so now we can basically go back and forth between these two pages because they're now connected through these links so we can go to the blog we can go back and forth and so on and so forth all right so let's close up this one here we don't need it anymore and just to finish we can also actually specify a link that doesn't go anywhere let me show that to you as well so let's just write the content first and here I have challenges I think in the demo so we have challenges flexbox in CSS grid so that's challenges but Watch What Happens now uh when I reload the page like this so you see that it only says challenges but notice how it's just normal text it's not blue and not underlined so it's clearly not a link right so even though it is actually an anchor element but what makes an anchor element really a link is the H ref property and so we really need to specify it otherwise it is not a link at all it is then just an anchor uh which is not really useful now but what if we don't want this to point anywhere as I was saying well the solution to that is to specify this hash symbol right here right so if I now save it and reload then we are back to this being a link actually it just doesn't Point anywhere what happens uh when you click on this link is that basically it goes back to the top of this current page okay and a little bit later in the course we will actually make use uh of this Behavior but for now I just want you to know that this is how we can specify links when we don't have any URL yet for them or don't have any page so basically this is like a placeholder link okay and so let's just copy this here twice there's no need to write it again but of course if you want you can write it again so just for this Flex boox in CSS grid so just to make that navigation look a bit more like complete but all of these links they should not Point anywhere okay and this is how you specify links or hyperlinks or anchors as we can also call them in HTML so this is a really important part of the web as I said in the very beginning and so make sure that you understand how they work and how we place them inside our own web pages so we already learned a couple of very important HTML elements and are already able to create a nice page with some nice functionality as well but now it's time to actually add some structure to our document and to our elements and so let's now learn a couple of new HTML 5 elements for that now when I said that the page is lacking some structure what I meant is that all of these elements that we placed in our document they're all simply like appearing one after another here right they're not really uh like distinguished from one another and especially they're not like grouped together in any logical way and so let's change that by creating some container Elements which will then group these elements together so one of the things that first come to mind is these links here so we have all of these links and this kind of looks like a page navigation here right so a page navigation is usually what we want when we have a couple of links at the top of a page and so what we can do is to specify a special element and then place all the links into that element and the element that I mean is called nef so nef which stands for navigation so just like this and now these need to be indented or they should be at least and so when I give it a save then prier formats this automatically and now these four links are nicely grouped into this container here so into this parent element which is a navigation now the thing is that when we now update our page it does look exactly the same so all that happens here is that this basically created like an invisible box which now contains uh these elements okay so the element on itself doesn't do anything all it does is to group these elements together and I understand that right now it doesn't really seem intuitive or logical to be doing this but trust me once we reach the section where we build some layouts and actually also in the next section just on CSS it will be very important to have all these different parts inside of their own containers all right so looking at our page uh basically this is now the navigation and this here is uh the heading then after that we have all of this here which is basically our uh post so our blog post right so this is kind of different uh than this top part so all of this uh is the blog post again and this is like the top part of our web page so what we can do is to group this navigation and the heading into a header element all right so let's do that so this is another HTML 5 element which is called header and the header basically means the top part of a web document or it can also mean the top part of some smaller unit as we will actually see in a minute and anyway this is uh just an introduction to these HTML 5 elements we will use them even more and I will explain them even more when we build our big website project a little bit later in this course okay so again nothing will have changed visually but now we told the browser like hey all of this year is our web page header so it's the top part of our uh page then all of this as I mentioned before starting here uh is the main part of the page which is in this case a blog post and a very common element that that we can use for a blog post is the article element so this is yet another uh container element but this time it's one for an article and article in this context actually does not uh simply mean a written article like this but it can also be like things from the real world like a computer is an article or a pen or a phone so all of these are articles and if somehow we need a to represent a computer in HTML then article would also be a good element for that okay and so now basically um our body has only two direct child elements we only have a header and we have article which is when we look at our page really all we have so we have the header and we have all of the rest which is our article so that is now nicely placed inside of its own box now one thing that you might ask well if these boxes all of them don't do anything then why don't we call all of them just NV or all of them header or all of them article so this one could also be article and nothing would change on the page right however we don't do that for something called semantic HTML and I will explain briefly what that means in the next video but now continuing even further uh we can actually do some more grp grouping here inside of our article so notice how we have kind of this top part here of the article so basically the heading the author here and also the image so this is kind of the top part of our article and then here we have the content itself right and so once again notice how I said that this is like the top part of the article so just like this here is the top part of the entire web page so what that means is that here again we should use a header element to basically Mark that up and by marking up I mean to basically describe the content in a better way so as I just said inside of the article we want to also have a header so inside of that header there should be um this heading this author image the author name and then here uh this image okay and then closing it now all of this uh is of course a little bit subjective as well so what seems very logical here to me might not be as logical for other developers but I think that what we just did here uh up until this point is quite logical for everyone and makes sense so again this one here is the header part of the article and with this we gave our article a little bit more structure so we have the header and only after that then comes the rest of the content okay so this is looking quite nice already uh but finally if we look at our demo here there's actually one thing missing and in fact there's multiple things so we don't have these related posts yet but we will take care of that later but we also have this part here at the bottom so it's this copyright notice here and this kind of content that comes at the very end of a page is what we usually call the footer and so there's actually as you might have guessed a special element for that as well in HTML 5 so footer and then let's close it also like this and now let's grab actually the text from here oh actually it's not here so we have to just write it manually and now here we have two options so to write the this text we could create a paragraph and then put that text in there or we could actually also write the text right here into this footer okay and this is uh in fact what I will do now so in this case there is just no need here to create yet another paragraph because it's going to be the only child of this footer element here anyway and so there's no need then so copyright and now here you see this uh copyright symbol which I'm sure you know so how do we create that well this is something called an HTML entity so actually this is something new so let me show you quickly how we do that so we write an M perent like this and then in this case I already know the name of the character that I want so I can just start writing copy and so then I can select this one here or I can just write the semi colon and then we're done so this HTML entity here is what represents this see here okay and there are entire tables for HTML entities and I have one on my resources page I think I haven't mentioned that resources page yet but there is a link to it in the very first text lecture in the first section and also uh in the GitHub repository that I showed you in one of the first lectures and there you will find a link to a page which contains all of these HTML entities but anyway we will talk a little bit more about this later in the course anyway the code magazine okay so written in the future give it a save and once again let's reload and as people were expecting uh the visual aspect of the page is still the same as I mentioned in the beginning so these again are just important to group the content into logical Parts which is important for semantic HTML and also for styling with CSS as you will see in the next section and speaking of semantic HTML that is going to be the topic of our next video so I hope to see you there very soon so I mentioned the term semantic HTML a couple of times in this section and so let's now actually uh very quickly Define what I actually mean by semantic HTML so in HTML when we talk about semantic what we mean is that certain elements have actually a meaning or a purpose attached to them so when we think about a certain HTML element we should actually not think about what that element looks like as it's rendered on the page but instead we should think about what that element actually means and what it stands for so that is basically the definition of semantic HTML now not all elements in HTML are semantic and actually I talked a little bit about that before uh here in this element so the strong element which makes our element look bold here on the page so remember how previously I used the uh B element which simply turns its content bolt but doesn't attach it any meaning right so I explained that before and so now maybe it makes a bit more sense so again by using the strong element here uh the text will still look bolt here in the browser but what really matters here is that we now assigned some meaning to this content here we now say that is a strong content which means basically a very important piece of content and the same here uh for this piece so this fundamental word here so again we use uh em for emphasizing this and so it still looks italic here on the web page but what we really mean is that we emphasized this word here so we gave it a special emphasis and uh yeah that's what this element here right now means okay and the same is actually true for all of these elements that we used in the last video so for example here this navigation element all this does is to create a box remember which then contains these four anchor elements but visually it doesn't really do anything all this does is to represent as a meaning that this is a navigation but instead of using nav we could also have used a more generic element which is the div element so for example div open and close it here and again visually nothing will change and so all this did was to create a new box but a box without any meaning so that's what div stands for so back in the day before HTML 5 we always used divs for every single box box that we needed like this on the page but then HTML 5 came around and introduced this concept of semantic HML and so now we should only use the diff element when we don't want to attach a certain meaning uh to a certain container so to a certain like box element on our page so in this case we really want this to mean that it's a navigation and so we use uh the navigation element for that okay and the same is true for the artical the header um the footer that we have down here and in fact it is true even for the paragraph for example because all that this paragraph here and all the other paragraphs really are are essentially boxes filled with text now the P of course does have a semantic meaning it means that it is a paragraph but we could again use a generic box without any meaning so this diff and nothing would change visually okay actually something did change here so we lost some of the wi space that we do have around the P all right so let's put it back here anyway to the P because we want it to have some meaning and of course we also want the spacing that the browser gives this by default around the P elements okay but the idea that I mentioned still holds because we could very easily recreate this space here uh using some CSS later so if we wanted we could in fact build the entire web page only out of div elements if we wanted and then use CSS to style them as we want but of course we don't do that we use semantic HTML to give our elements meaning now you might ask why we actually do that and there are multiple reasons and I think I mentioned uh them already actually so one of them is search engine optimization which basically means that search engines such as Google will be able to understand the structure of your content and therefore they will be better able to analyze what your content and what your web page is all about also writing semantic HTML is extremely important for accessibility and especially for people who rely on screen readers to consume or web pages okay so I hope that this makes sense and we will uh also keep touching on this subject as we go through the rest of the course but I still wanted to make it very clear from the very beginning that when we think about HTML we should not only think about how it actually looks like in the browser but even more about what these elements actually mean and what they stand for and with that being said uh we kind of finished uh all we had to learn in this section and so in the next video we will uh configure vs code a little bit more and then we will move on to two final challenges in this section so don't wait and let's move on to the next lecture here welcome back so we started configuring or vs code editor uh in the very beginning of the course but now at this point we are ready to install three additional extensions that will make our lives a little bit easier as we code HTML and CSS and so let's head over to our extensions panel here and the first extension that I want to install here is called image preview so it's this one and I already have it installed so I just need to click on enable Okay so that's the first one and what this one is uh going to do is that here in our HTML it now displays the small image preview here in this gutter as it's called so here we have this one and then this image here is also right here where we declare it so where we include it in our code and this can be extremely helpful uh sometimes so that's why I really wanted to show you this one um the next one that I want to show you is called color highlighter or highlight so it's this one here and again I I already have it installed I just enable it and actually this one I cannot show you yet what it looks like because it will only be relevant in CSS but trust me that this extension is really really helpful for visualizing colors in CSS next up is an extension called autor rename uh tag so this one and you see it's an extremely popular one uh once again so you have to download it and enable it and then uh what happens here is that uh uh when we change the name of an element let's say we actually wanted to make this one a div then you see it automatically also changes uh the closing one so the closing tag okay and this again is extremely helpful it makes our life writing HTML a bit easier because trust me uh we need to do this all the time like changing the element name okay now another thing that we need to do or at least that we can do if we want is to go back to our settings and then turn back on this setting that we deactivated at the beginning of the section so that's the auto let's spell that right so autoc close tag so let's enable this back because I think at this point you will no longer make the mistake of forgetting a closing tag and so now we can allow vs code to do that work for us so for example if we wanted to write a paragraph here then now you see HTML automatically closed that element for us okay but this we don't need and now we are going to install the most important and the most useful one of all and that is called live server so it's this one here uh live server with almost 12 million downloads and this one is popular for a reason so I just click enable here and so when I go now to my HTML and let's close this one down so close down the sidebar now down here in this bar we should have now this go live button okay so hopefully after installing this live server extension you can also see this button down here uh in this status bar so when I now click this then it's starting and we get this message that server is started at this port number here let's close that and you see that it opened a new tab which contains our page right so basically it looks exactly the same but there is one very big difference so let's let's say we want to change this here and I'm going to call it Jonas's code and now look closely what happens here as I save this file so I hit command s now or control s on Windows and you see what happened it automatically reloaded the page without us having to do anything so all we did was save the code and what will then happen is that this page here gets automatically updated so all the changes that we did here will basically get injected into this page and yeah we can then see the reflection of our changes immediately so I put it back now hit again uh command or contr S to save it and immediately you see it going back to what it was before now if we wanted to stop this connection once we are done developing all we have to do is to click down here on this icon here where it says Port 5500 and by the way this port number is exactly what we have here okay so just for the sake of curiosity this one here means that it's a local host server so basically it's like you have now a web server on your own computer running and then we have uh actually this code running at this port number and so this port it's basically like a sub address of your web server so of the local Local Host server but this doesn't really matter what matters is that this now works and it is really really helpful for our development workflow now if for some reason you could not make this work on your computer then of course don't worry so you can still do it the old way so basically the way we have been doing it all along up until this point so you can just uh open up the file from your uh file system like we did and then keep refreshing it manually right but we right now no longer need this tab here because we now have our live connection so we have our live server uh serving up this page here whenever we do some edits all right and with that we are now ready to tackle our final last two coding challenges in this HTML fundamental section now it's time for the first big coding challenge in in this course so let's get started now before we start with the actual challenge I want to First make some changes to the file structure that we have in this project right now and in particular what I want to do is to put all the images into one folder so that I can then show you how we can include the images like this when they are uh located in a specific folder so right now they are all as we can see here they're all in the same exact same folder as the index.html and so that's why all we have to do uh is to declare the name here and the browser will then find them basically in the same folder as the HTML document but now let's create a new folder by clicking this icon and I'm going to call it IMG and then I'm going to put all of the images there so just dragging and dropping them like this okay and so now if we reload the page and not this one which is our demo but the one we're working on and by the way this time I had to actually manually reload the page uh because uh I had my computer turned off in the meantime and so whenever you do that the very first time you come back you will have to manually reload uh the page here when you are running the live server extension okay so remember that we installed that in the last video and so if I do some change here now then that should probably uh just work just before so you see there's some change and there it appeared but anyway you see that now that we have uh these images inside of the IMG folder they are no longer uh found in the same folder as index.html so that's why they don't appear up here so what we need to do here is to change the path to the image now and that's not a difficult problem all we have to do is to start the new path with the name of the folder so that's IMG and then slash and so here we go so you see the image appears here now again in this Gutter and so let's do the same thing here give it a save and here are our images back okay so usually we always put the images in a separate folder and so I thought that was important to show you especially now before this challenge where we are going to use some more images so about the challenge uh I'm being here back in the demo page and so essentially what I want you to do is to code on your own this part here all right and let me actually show you where that should be in our markup so in our HTML and it is right here after the article okay so this section here about the related posts is no longer part of the article it's also not part of the footer and so here we will need another element and this one I will actually write for you so here we are going to use the aside element and the aside element is usually used for some secondary information that complements the information in the main part of the page so in this case the main part of the page is the article and then the aside which is secondary information is basically some related posts that are related to the article so to the main part okay now visually many times we use the aside element as a sidebar but it doesn't have to be that way okay but now about uh the challenge itself so you see that it starts here with this heading so you can experiment which heading is best here so one of the headings H1 2 3 4 5 and six remember and then uh here you see that this is actually a list right you can see that because of these bullet points and so here for this part you should probably use a list now what we didn't do before was to have multiple elements inside of one list item so up here for example we have the list item and in there there's only some text but you see that here in each item there's an image a link and then uh some more text here and that's no problem at all so inside of each list element there can be multiple other uh child elements right and so with that information I think you are now able to build this now finally just about the images here that's some more information that you need they are also in this folder and they are called related 1 2 and 3 and the dimensions I want you to give them is 75x 75 pixels and now I think I gave you everything so please pause the video now and take a couple of minutes 10 15 minutes maybe to write up the HTML for this section so good luck with that and I see you once you're ready all right so hopefully you did this just just fine so let me show you how I did it and I hope that you uh start to see how helpful it is that vs code now automatically closes uh or or HTML elements right so the source here is in the IMG folder and then related one then the alt text uh let's just say that this is a person programming and of course your alt text doesn't have to be exactly the same as mine so if if your alt text is a bit different that is not a problem at all and now we need to close it as well and so that's uh that's the image part next we have uh a hyperlink so an anchor tag and here the hre which is something that I didn't mention but uh hopefully you figured it out that this is one of the links that should not Point anywhere for now so how to learn web development and now finally there's some text with the author there and so we can use a paragraph for that so by Jonas schetman okay giving it a save now it's nicely formatted and it should appear down here here and indeed here it is great oh I'm just missing here uh The Heading actually so let me go back and put that uh even before the unordered list so I'm using an H4 for that but anyway let's continue now building our list here with the next list item and by the way if you did uh your code a little bit different from mine uh that's that's really not a problem what matters here is that you uh tried writing the code on your own um that is really the most important thing that I was expecting you to do here so with 75 the height also 75 and again a a link pointing nowhere and this one is the unknown powers of CSS and by Jim Dylan and I'm not going to check out the result uh just yet let's just uh finish it so another image so the goal of this part here was really to have you practice writing this same code basically or very similar code over and over again because this is the only way that uh this stuff really gets into your brain so let's call this one JavaScript code on a screen and again the width of 75 and the height of 75 and you notice I'm writing this uh a little bit faster right now because uh we don't want to waste a lot of time writing this repetitive code this was really just for you to practice is aome finally the paragraph give it a save and beautiful so this looks just like in our demo and we have now all this content that we want to display here nicely marked up in a very logical way so you might be wondering why we used a list here in this case and the reason for that is basically the idea behind semantic HTML that I explained a little bit earlier so if we think about these related posts we can very easily argue that it is essentially a list of related posts right and so if it is a list we should Mark it up in our HTML so we should write or HTML as a list and so that's just what we did later with CSS we will then remove these bullet points because they don't make a lot of sense in this context but even with the bullet points removed we still want the meaning uh of this element so of all of this year to be a list but anyway that's enough for this video so I really HED that you completed this Challenge and that you enjoyed doing it even if it took some time and even if you had to review some Concepts from the previous lectures that's completely normal and that's exactly how it should be actually now in order to practice a little bit more even there is another coding challenge coming up which is uh completely detached from this project but it's a really exciting one so I hope to see you there soon time for another exciting coding challenge so that you can keep practicing your new HTML skills and in this one I want you to build this component for this Converse Allstar shoe and I'm saying component here because I want you to imagine this content here in the context of something like an e-commerce store so imagine that we have a shoe store and there are multiple shoes and for each of them there is then like the small component with this description so stuff like the price uh a short description a link and then some product details here now I am building this component so I'm writing this HTML on a special coding platform called codepen.io so this is a place online where we can basically write our code and it will then automatically execute the code and render it and it makes it also easy to share that code now of course you don't need to use codepen in order to complete this challenge you can just go to your code editor and for example add a brand new HTML file here and then uh build all the code in there the reason why I'm not doing that here in the video is because we're actually going to build on this challenge uh later so we will keep developing this very small project over the next few sections and that would then create a mess of different files and a lot of different code uh but of course uh because you're doing it on your own on your own computer it's easier for you and so you can just as I said if you want create a new HTML file and do it here but on the other hand I think it's also helpful and useful for you to learn a little bit about codepen.io and uh create the challenge there so let me just give you a very quick demonstration of codepen so just Google codepen I would say or you can go to codepen.io and then all you have to do is to click here on start coding now maybe in the future uh something has changed about code pen so about this interface but you will always be able to create a new code pen simply by going to codepen.io pen so just like this so here we basically have a panel where we can write HTML uh CSS and JavaScript if we want or we can also just uh collapse these panels if we don't need them which is the case right now and so here we can write our HTML let's just write an H1 element hello world for example and you see that here we have to again manually uh close the element but anyway you see that after some time it then renders the results down here so in this results panel basically you can also change the name of your code pen so let's say uh challenge to which is the name of this lecture okay and then you can uh also save it now to save it you will have to create a free account but I would say that it's actually worthwhile uh to do so but of course uh it's optional and you're not forced to create a new account here but if you do that is actually very helpful because then you will get a special URL for each code pen and then you can share that code pen with others so if you want to just like create uh a quick example a quick demo of something to show it to someone then you can just come to codepen uh create it right here and then copy paste the URL from here once you have saved it and by the way what I just described is actually also the best way of sharing code in the Q&A section on UD in case you run into any problems okay so again it would probably be a good idea to create an account here uh because it's just useful and many many programmers use codepen it's a very popular tool but anyway going back now to the challenge let me give you a couple of hints okay so this is what the result looks like that I want you to build but uh to help you a little bit I will actually need to change your bit of the code so here in change view we can uh now switch to the editor view which will then look what just like what I showed you before all right so now we have the editors here on top and then the result down here so there are some things I need to explain uh before you can get started so first of all I want you to wrap all of this content inside an article element and remember how I mentioned that an article element can not only be used for something like a written blog Post article but also for like really a physical article and so a shoe like this is a perfect example for that so this is an article and again coming back to the example of having like uh an e-commerce store then each shoe would be a different article and so you would have one article element for yeah for each of the shoes right then uh down here there is an element that we have never used which is this clickable button and so down here you see that this is simply the button element and so you can just go ahead and use that and then finally there's something uh else which is this symbol here so this Arrow here now remember how uh back in our project so here I mentioned that this symbol right here this Copyright symbol is an HTML entity right remember that and so this Arrow here is just another HTML entity and I also mentioned back then that there is a very handy list on my resources page which is this one now if you're watching this in the future then this page probably looks uh quite different but for now this is what I have and um the HTML entity reference that I meant so that I mentioned earlier is this one so let's just open it up actually and then there is a lot of stuff that you can use so all of these different symbols and here for example is the copy uh symbol that we used before in vs code now this is a huge list and I'm just going to use a command or contr F to search uh on the page for arrows and here we go so there are all these different arrows here and the one that I used is this so to insert this Arrow into your own HTML code all you have to do is to write this HTML entity okay and yeah I will leave this oh well actually we don't need it anymore right oh and just one more thing which is the image so you cannot really upload images to codepen unless you have a paid account but that doesn't make sense I think and so I actually uploaded the image for you onto this URL so you see that this is actually another way of including images so essentially an image that is coming from a certain URL so in contrast uh right here when we wrote Our Cod before then the source was always an image on our own computer so in this case in the image folder and then this image name and if you're building this Challenge on your own computer then you can just use this challenge image here so it's exactly the same okay but if you're building it on codepen like I'm going to do then you will need this image that is located at this URL so just copy this here somehow from the screen and use it for your own project then the dimensions of the image should be 250 by 250 and with this I think I gave you everything that you need to know so go ahead and copy this URL and now I will switch to the full page view so that you can see everything at once and now uh I will just leave you to it and come back here in 5 or 10 minutes once you are ready okay here we are back and I I hope that it wasn't too much of a challenge for you so that it wasn't too hard so hopefully you got to practice your skills a little bit more and so now in case you have any doubt or you run into any problem I will now show you my solution here so as I mentioned we are using an article here and now for the heading I used an H2 actually not an H1 because of that idea of this being a component with within a bigger page okay and so each page should only have one H1 and so if we then have multiple articles then each of them should just be an H2 Converse Chuck Taylor All Star well I could have just copied this from the uh demo but anyway so IMG and now I will actually go ahead and copy this URL here in the editor view okay then the alt text is just copying it now here oh this should be enough like this and then the height and the width and 250 and here it is here is our image great now let's go back here and actually copy all of this content why not then we can just uh after that wrap everything into its own element so here we have the price and I will keep using a paragraph uh for each of these elements so for each of the text elements then we have free shipping okay oh and you see that uh code pen actually automatically did some indentation there so that's quite helpful then here there is another uh another paragraph right so we are getting our content formatted except of course for all the content that is not inside any element so remember how I mentioned that uh HTML doesn't care about any spacing or about any enters so like line breaks everything is just in the same line and so that's why we need to structure our content in a logical way now here we have that anchor element and actually I didn't really tell you where this link should point to so you could have just created an empty link like this basically or you could have linked the Converse website so let me just grab that link so converse.com probably and I'm doing it like this you will see in a moment why and the reason is because we actually need this https colon SL slash so the entire URL this is not necessary here and now here let's uh close this and here of course we do not just want this symbol because this is not really correct so instead we want that HTML entity that you hopefully used so that is the right arrow so this is the abbreviation here for R stands for right and then R for Arrow and so indeed this is the result that we got okay so we have all of this part now let's take care of uh this list here and this heading and finally then also this button so I have an H2 already up here right and so for this one I'm using uh an H3 now H3 and closing it nice and now remember uh in order to create a list which is what we want here so a bullet pointed list we use the unordered element or actually the unordered list element and now we just wrap all of these into one Li element right so I hope that at this point uh you already know these elements so you you have practiced a lot and so I'm sure that uh this is getting a lot more easy for you now let's just remove this dot here and we are almost done so all we need now is that button in the end and so as I showed you before for that we can simply use the button element in HTML so add to card and of course that button so clicking that button will not do anything thing for that we would need some JavaScript but at least it is here visible okay and we see here that we have 80 unsaved changes so if you want to preserve those changes again you would have to save the code pen uh and create a free account in order to do that oh and I thought that we were actually done uh with this challenge but there is one small piece missing so this text here uh in the original is actually bold so that's the only difference so that's something that we're missing and so let's simply uh wrap this value here so all this text into a strong element not string strong and you see now at this point we didn't close uh this tag so this strong element and so now all the rest of the content basically became strong so everything is Bolt now because this element never ends but of course uh that would be a mistake wouldn't even be valid HTML but the browsers somehow uh still are able to render it somehow but anyway with this we finished this Challenge and actually also the introduction to HTML section so make sure to review everything that you just learned in the section all your new skills and then once you're ready uh we can together move on to or next section which will be the fundamentals of CSS and so there you will finally learn how to actually style your content and make it look a little bit more polished and more beautiful so that's really really exciting and so yeah once you ready let's move on there see you soon"},{video_id:"Z4moxjE-NB0",title:"Locofy.ai | Generating code with Semantic Tags

your code easy to read and understand it also helps to make your content more accessible and SEO friendly with local fire you can generate semantic tags for containers and text for containers simply select your frame on figma then select the container tag on the plugin you can now choose the appropriate semantic tag in this case this is a header here's another example where we tag the footer using the footer tag you can also assign semantic tags for text simply select the text layer in figma then choose the text tag on the plugin you can then select the semantic tag you want to use this

Development",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtK3RYjEH2I",duration:3004,transcript:"hello everyone welcome to v2 e-sectional myself mr nitin kumar working as an assistant professor in department of computer science and engineering with the avatar college of engineering mysuru i am the course expert for mobile application development the subject code is 18 cs651 firstly i would like to thank the person who has framed this syllabus as an open elective why because the contents which are present in this particular syllabus it is completely correlated with the contents which are available in google for certification program so if we divide the syllabus so the syllabus consists of five modules out of those five modules the first two modules deals with activities and intents and the basic designs how to design the mobile application so the remaining three modules deals with how to publish an application what are the security features that you have to consider in your mobile applications while development along with that how to make use of databases and how to develop an interactive application that you're going to learn so totally five modules the contents which are present in this five modules will make the syllabus of associate android developer certification so if you are done with the contents of this five modules you can easily take up the certification examination that is provided by the google on android platform the certification name is associate android developer certification so which can be taken in two languages one is either in java or in kotlin as per your syllabus that is present in vtu so the subject is should be taught using java programming language coming to the subject my subject name is mobile application development and the code is 18cs651 so before we start with the what is development and other things firstly we should know what is mobile application what is mobile application so why because without knowing what is mobile applications so it is not possible to understand what is development so coming to this mobile application means nothing but the facebook instagram whatsapp the apps that you're going to use in your mobile such applications are called mobile applications don't feel that only the applications that you are going to use in your mobile mobile application even in your smart watches we can develop the mobile applications for smart watches we can develop the mobile application nowadays for automotive such as for example the sound system present in your car that's also in a mobile application and for example the nowadays the tv smart tv the name is android tv that will also make use of android so coming to this mobile application so it's nothing but the applications that you're going to develop for mobile devices are called mobile applications so we can divide this mobile applications into three categories the development developing the mobile application for your mobile devices is called mobile application development which can be categorized into three categories one is based on android one is completely based on android operating system android operating system it's nothing but a linux based operating system it's an open source other one is based on ios i guess you are well versed with this term ios why because ios is nothing but it is commonly used it is commonly used only in apple devices so next one is flutter these are the three ways or these are the three platforms that we have for developing the mobile applications so what is this android mobile application development means so android o mobile development means so where we are going to make use of a tool by name android studio by name android studio to develop the android application so if you develop the application by using this android studio men's so it will work only in your android devices the applications which are developed by using this android studio will be compatible only with the android devices similarly if you develop applications using ios means those application will be compatible only with the apple devices such as apple smart smartphones apple tabs so whatever the application that you are going to develop by using this ios platform which will be compatible with the apple devices so coming to this flutter so this is also called as an ibreed platform what is this hybrid platform is so whatever the applications that you're going to develop by using this flutter will be compatible both with the apple devices as well as android devices so coming to this up these are the frameworks that we are going to use android studio ios and flutter so which are all the languages why because framework is not a complete development tool framework is a tool that's it so inside the framework you have to make use of programming language to develop the applications so which are all the programming languages we need to use the programming languages that we are going to use for the android application development is java as well as kotlin so initially when i started working with this android in year 2016 it was completely java there was no kotlin at all so in 2020 this quarterly award so by 2023 google is giving a statement that they are going to completely remove this java and they are going to replace the kotlin for mobile application development but the thing is so the framework will remain the same just the change change that is happening here is only the programming language will change previously it was java now we have kotlin next down the line there might be some other user friendly programming language may arrive that we can use for the mobile application development the programming languages will keep on changing but the framework will remain the same the outcome of this subject is you must learn how to make use of this android studio don't worry about this program why because the programming languages will keep on changing but the framework will remain the same similarly with respect to ios devices the apple devices the programming language that we are going to use right now is shift the programming language that we are using is swift programming language we will use to develop the apple applications which will be compatible only with the ios devices coming to the programming language that we are going to use with respect to flutter is dart dart dart so if you develop what's the advantage of this flutter application means so whatever the application mobile application that you're going to develop using flutter will be compatible both with the ios as well as android os that's the advantage of flutter but as per your syllabus coming to confining to your syllabus these are the three ways you can develop the mobile application one this by using android other one is by using ios other one is by using flutter so if we confine your syllabus so as per your syllabus you must learn how to make use of android studio using java this is your complete syllabus the syllabus that is present in 18 cs651 deals with android studio using java programming language so why why i need to study this particular subject what's the importance what's the importance just if you understand just if you look at the global market so when i was a student so i need i i used to go to web applications i need to browse the web applications to get the required information or features but nowadays whatever the web applications are there for them the corresponding mobile app will be there in your google play store that indicates the importance of this subject so as the number of application increases the number of roles for the mobile application developer increases so if you know this mobile application development you can easily you can easily be industry ready so coming to this mobile application development how many users are there so if you consider 100 percent mobile person mobile users in world involved out of 100 71 percent users are android users 71 percent users are using android so in india if you consider this scenario in india 95 percent users are android users as i mentioned earlier there are only three flavors of mobile applications and three flavors of operating systems so android operating system and ios devices other than that we will have microsoft nokia lumia such devices and their market is very low so if you consider the world market out of 100 71 percent users are using android phones so in india especially in india 95 users are using android devices so remaining five percent of 3.2 percent belongs to apple users and remaining other like blackberry and uh by lawyers and microsoft users microsoft lumia nokia devices okay so this is the importance of this subject why because the graph is gradually growing initially in 2014 it was some presently now in india there are 1.1 billion users are there using smartphones so 1.1 billion users are using the mobile devices out of 1.1 billion users 700 700 million users are connected to internet means they are using smartphones out of 700 million users 95 percent users are based on android that's the importance of this subject why you need to learn this subject so forget it okay so i know only one programming language so just what's the importance of this subject so if you know this subject so you can survive anywhere in your in the industry why because this subject is having a huge scope though just analyze this market out of one 1.4 1.45 billion population 1.1 billion use population is using smart phones so out of those 1.1 billion 700 million phones are connected to the internet means they are using smartphones so out of 700 million 95 users are android based that's the importance of this subject that's why i conveyed thanks to the person who has framed this subject as an open elective so coming to this subject firstly i'm going to provide a brief overview on android application development why because as i mentioned earlier as i mentioned earlier so android application development so your subject completely confines towards the android application development using java so we can develop the android application in two ways one is by using java programming language other one is by using kotlin programming language as per the syllabus present so we have to use java in android studio the tool that we are going to use is android studio so firstly i'm going to brief the basic building blocks basic building blocks so of android so we have three basic building blocks in android so first one is activities first one is activities second one is intents third one is services so if you learn these three features if you learn if you are done with this basic building blocks of android you are done with your whole syllabus you are done with the whole syllabus of google associate android developer certification so i will take one by one so what is this basic building blocks we what is this activities intents and services so firstly basic building announcements so this all three together we will will make the mobile application using android there should be activities there should be intents there should be services these three put together will frame a mobile application what is this activities are so activity is nothing but a blank white sheet like this okay so it's an empty activity it's a blank white paper whatever you want you can design here i need a button i will place it i need a text to indicate my name i will place it whatever you want you can design in this blank paper such thing is called as an activity such thing is called activity so i if you are if you know about the web application so for example there might be 500 web pages 500 web pages together we call it as a website if you consider our video website there might be around thousand web pages together we call it as meet your website we do dot ac dot in similarly there might be n number of activities n number of activities together we call it as a single mobile application so please remember one thing one activity means it's nothing but a blank white sheet blank white sheet so where whatever the feature whatever the attribute whatever the widget that you want like button text box or whatever you want you are going to place inside that activity okay so such activities n number of activities together we call it as a single mobile application similarly how 500 web pages together we call it as a website so five consider 500 websites just assume 500 web pages are there in v2 website 500 web pages together we call it as a single website similarly n number of activities there might be 100 activities together we call it as a whatsapp application so if you just if you check your whatsapp application just you can uh check the scroll bar just in the navigation pane itself you can find the three option one is chart other one is message other one is status so chart itself is a separate activity status itself is a separate activity chart itself is a separate activity call itself is a separate activity just by clicking on the chat it will open the message related thing just by clicking on the status it will open the status just clicking on the call it will open the call means so you are transiting between the three activities like that android activities together call it as a single application there is no constraint that there might be any activities itself to make a single application you want a single activity we can we can call it as a single application but to serve the purpose we need more than one activity together we call it as a single mobile application just make sure that what is activity is nothing but a blank sheet blank white page where we are going to design our requirements so coming to this intent coming to this intense intents are nothing but user intentions user intentions what is that user intentions means user intentions so user intentions means just i don't know how many of you are watching this video or the users of facebook or instagram so in this facebook you will come across some news articles so if you click on that news articles it will ask the help of google chrome or opera mini browser to open that article that means so you are present in facebook application from the facebook application to complete that action you need another application by name google chrome so such kind of intentions or code as an user intentions there are two types of user intentions one is explicit other one is implicit these are the two types of intents which are present in android one is explicit other one is implicit what is this x plus it means what is this implicit means simple explicit means so if the communication is happening within the application if the communication is happening within your mobile app such intentions are called explicit intentions for example this is my whatsapp application where i have three tabs there are three steps one is chart other one is status other one is call so if i click on this call it will open the call related things which are present in your account that means you are not accessing the other application you are transiting from one activity to the this is my main activity this is my main page right this is what you're going to get when you open the whatsapp with three options chat status call so if i click on call it will open the activity the corresponding to call similarly if i click on status it will open the activity related to status means just absorb so there will be a back button if you click on this back button it will come back to the home page or main page main activity so here what i'm doing here i'm transiting between the two activities which are present inside the whatsapp application inside which application inside the whatsapp application this kind of transition is called as an explicit transition or explicit user intentions where the transition is going to happen within the application itself so what is the explicit between the two applications between the two applications for example consider your so your you have chat so i am the user i have sent one link v2 dot ac dot in so you will you will click on this message so if you click on this message your whatsapp doesn't have that feature to open its own browser so it will ask it will open a pop-up indicating whether you need to open it with google chrome other whether you need to open with opera mini so you if i select google chrome it will open the v2 website vtu dot ac dot in just observe your this is my whatsapp application from the whatsapp from the whatsapp application i am opening my google chrome this kind of intentions are called explicit intense make it simple explicit means if the transition is happening within the application means with whatever the application the time i am having i'm not transiting between the two application i'm transiting within my app for example in whatsapp how you're going to transit between the chat status and call options so implicit intents means so if you try to open a url it will ask the help of browser so it will be opened using the browser means your whatsapp application is making use of browser to complete the task such kind of intents are called implicit intents this is the second building block that we are going to use in our android application development or the term mobile application development so coming to the last building block that is nothing but services so please remember one thing with respect to services we have lot of already available services which is present in android studio just the thing is you must know how to use them you are not going to design something new just for example i need to create a database the sqlite service is already available we have sqlite just the thing is you must know how to use that sqlite in your mobile application development for example i need to create alarm application we have already have alarm service in this android studio just the thing is you must know how to use that alarm service so to create alarm application so for example i am going to use i am going to create a music player we already have a music applications which are running which are already present in the android studio just the thing is you must know how to make use of this kind of services okay that can be used in your mobile apps so this three put together will make any mobile application make it simple the syllabus is simple just the thing is what is activity whenever you're going to create a project whenever you're going to create application so it will open a blank page where you're going to design your requirements that's what we call activity so one activity will not make the mobile application n activities together we call it as a single mobile application what is intense it's nothing but user intention for example i am present in chat of whatsapp i need to go to status this kind of intentions are called explicit intents where you are going to transit within the application within the application implicit intents so for example if my friend has sent a url i will click on that url so it will ask to browser to complete the task such if that transition is happening between the application such intents are called implicit intents so next services the basic services which are required for any application development is already available in android studio just the thing is you must know how to use them that's it so whatever for example i need to create a text to speech application so which is already available text speech service is already available just you must know how to use that service what are the prerequisites what are the programming constructs that you need to use okay the function is already available just the thing is you must learn how to use them so before we start with the development make sure that so the basic requirements for using for developing android applications you must have a system with i5 r i7 configuration the device should be the device so to run the android studio the device requirement is you must have a mission with i5r i7 or greater along with that minimum 8gb ram minimum 8gb ram these are the device requirements to run android studio or to develop the mobile application so if you try with i3 processor devices with 4gb ram it's highly impossible to develop any android application the minimum requirement the minimum this is not the maximum one the minimum requirement means you must have a device with i5 plus or i5 or above processor with 8gb ram capability then only you can execute the android studio code or then only you can develop the mobile applications using the android studio the framework throughout our syllabus the framework that we are going to use is android studio and the language that we are going to use is java so the concepts that we are going to cover throughout our syllabuses activities intents and services so first two modules deals with the activities and intents so the remaining three modules deals with the services where you're going to learn how to create a database how to retrieve the data how to show share how to save the shared preferences how to publish an application how to develop an alarm like such things so you're going to learn in the remaining three modules this is the overview of the subject mobile application development with the subject code 18 cs 651 one as i mentioned earlier there are five modules present in your syllabus the subject name is mobile application development with subject code 18cs651 so coming to the module number one so you have five contents five topics that i am covering in this module are which are all the prices which are present in your syllabus the first is so introduction to what is android you are going to learn what is android what is versions why you need versions and what is android architecture that things you're going to learn in introduction to android followed by you're going to develop the first application you're going to build the first mobile application with hands-on experience next layout what is layout what is view what is the resources such things you are going to learn here how to make use of available layouts we have a wide variety of layouts which are readily available for the design purpose followed by event handling so for example i have added a button to my design so if i do some actions how that event will be handled how the actions will be recognized such things are discussed in this event handling followed by activities what's the life cycle of activity when the activity starts when the activity resumes when the activity is dead such things you're going to learn here followed by intents as i mentioned earlier in intense you are going to learn about two types of intense one as explicit other one is implicit finally so how to test our debug the mobile application this is the overview of the syllabus that is present in module number one starting with the what is android you're going to develop a simple application finally you're going to con we are going to conclude this particular module one with testing and debugging so coming to this android what is that android means why 90 percent of indians are using android mobile phones not the ios or other why in word out of 100 71 percent users are using android why because the android is an open source so even if you want to develop an application you can develop by using android studio and you can execute that application without any hurdles you don't need any high-end configuration systems or you don't want or you want to you don't want to purchase any license why because it's an open source so it it will be based on the linux kernel what is that linux kernel means so please remember one thing we have three flavors of operating systems we have three flavors of operating system one is linux kernel based that is nothing but open source linux kernel based isn't it open source one other one is windows third one is apple or ios we have three flavors of operating systems linux based windows based and ios based where the linux base is an open source that makes that's the added advantage or that makes this android studio famous so what is this android who invented this android so the android so initially the android was developed by andy rubin and team so there are four people's four members who worked on this android and developed this android studio our android application and you might be shocked why they have developed this so they have developed this for dg cameras digital cameras but it gained popularity when it was used in smartphones in year 2005 so this android is overtaken by google so from then onwards it's a product that comes under google corporation okay so that makes it's an open source that makes that's the great advantage of this android so user inter generally this android will be used in touch screens and smart devices so over 80 percent of smartphones all over the world makes use of this android operating system so please remember one thing android is not a name of mobile device android is a name of operating system which is based on the linux kernel okay so we have three flavors of operating system such as windows linux and ios out of those three flavors linux is an open source one so that will be used in the android okay initially it was developed by andy rubin and team in 2005 it was overtaken by google so from then onwards till 2022 it's a product android is the application our android studio is a product that comes under google corporation so that the applications which are developed for this android will cover watchers tvs cars so we have around 2 million android apps in google play store that shows the importance of this subject mobile application development it's not a theoretical subject it's a practical subject so where you are going to learn how to develop the mobile application the two the one framework which is which is the number one framework why because around 90 percent 95 percent of indian users are using that framework the name is android so over 2 million android applications are available in google play store this this shows the importance of this subject and highly customized devices and windows so please remember one thing the applications which are developed in android which can be easily customized there is no constraints such as for example if you want to develop an application for ios so you have to develop the application in apple device itself it's not possible to develop the application in some other device and deploy it to apple okay so such constraints are the restrictions which are not present in android devices as i mentioned earlier the main advantage why it has gained the popularity because of it is a open source one so coming to this android studio as i mentioned earlier what is android android is just an operating system what is this android studio it's nothing but it's nothing but a framework so throughout our syllabus throughout the five modules the framework that we are going to use is android studio what is this android studio it's the official android ide official android framework where by using this official android framework you can develop the android applications okay so what are the features that are provided in this android studio why it is uh it should be used for mobile application development for android os why because you can develop the application by using this android studio you can run the application you can debug and you can test and you can package the apps so these are the features which are available in this official android id and please remember one thing so just note my words so even you can develop the android application by using some platforms such as thunkable mit app inventor please remember that so where you are that's not a core android application so such applications will be developed by school students it will not serve the purpose you cannot customize such applications to develop application which can be customized you have to make use of android studio as i mentioned earlier it supports two programming languages such as java and kotlin along with the android studio please remember so in android studio there is no need if you want to see the output for example if you are executing a c program if you are executing a java so where you are going to see the output in the console similarly if you want to see the output of the application that you have developed so it will provide a feature by name virtual devices you can create create your virtual mobile device there itself and you can see the output there itself that's the advantage that's the main feature of android studio that is it provides the virtual devices you can create a virtual phone in that framework and you can observe the output there itself and you can visualize the layout for example i need to design something so the design visualization will be present here so the design layout will be presented as a feature these are the features of the framework that we are going to use on our throw out syllabus the framework that we are going to use is android studio that is an official id of android that comes under google the language that we are going to use is java so coming to the architecture so it's an important part android platform architecture what is this android platform architecture so please observe your where we have five layers five layers first layer is application layer first layer is application layer it's nothing but the applications will run in this layer for example just i will take a scenario if you consider whatsapp that comes under this first layer it's an application whatsapp is an application so there are two types of applications one is system application other one is user application whatever you are going to use whatever you are using whatsapp facebook chat or other applications such applications will come under user application system applications means for example settings have you installed anything to for settings to change the settings in your device no it's a system application for every individual phone there will be a settings that's a system application okay such kind of applications will be running on the first layer that's why we call that layer as application layer first layer is application layer where you will be having two types of application one is system application other one is user application user application means wide variety of applications you have that may be game that may be video player that may be music player that may be whatsapp facebook chat whatever that comes under user application system application mess which we which which we we have not installed which generally comes when you purchase the device such as such applications such as security manager power management settings such things are system application that's about the first layer system and user apps or you can call it as application layer so next layer number two java api framework as i mentioned earlier there are a lot of services lot of services which are readily available in the android studio that you must know how to use so your system applications will make use of those services will make use of those services such as notification manager alarm manager music player such services will be available in this java apa framework so your applications will make use of those services to complete the task so application framework layer is the layer which provides the support for the applications which are present in the application layer so it has been written using java programming language that's why we have using the term java api framework application programming interface framework so next we have the third layer where native libraries and android runtime so i don't know how many of you watching this video know about java to run the java code we will make use of java virtual machine that is nothing but jvm similarly to execute the android application to execute the mobile application we will make use of dalvik virtual machine dvm so that will be present here that support will be present for every individual application that you are going to develop the java android runtime will be provided it's nothing but dalvik virtual machine so similar to the jvm that we use in our java so native library supports will be there native library disappointments the of device drivers for example to work to work with the wi-fi connectivity have you installed anything no there should be a device driver should be installed in your device to have the connection with your wi-fi to connect to to make use of bluetooth there will be a bluetooth device device so to make use of a browser there should be webkit device driver so to make use of graphics there will be opengl such kind of drivers such kind of libraries will be returned using c and c plus plus that comes in the third layer along with the runtime runtime means it's nothing but dvm dalvik virtual machine so that's about the third layer first layer is about application second layer is about the support to the application such as various managers third layer is about the various libraries are the device drivers along with the android runtime it's nothing but dalvik course machine so next hardware abstraction layer what is this hardware abstraction layer so if you consider your device if you consider a mobile where we have camera where we have bluetooth where we have gps where we have ram where we have memory uh how those hardware parts will be utilized by your application by using this hardware abstraction layer how the ram usage will be happened in your mobile apps by using this hardware abstraction layer how your camera turns on when you click on the camera application by this hardware abstraction layer so this hardware abstraction layer is nothing but an interface between the hardware devices hardware components which are present in your mobile along with the application for example in my whatsapp i will click on camera icon it will turn on camera how based on this hardware obstruction layer camera itself is a separating component that is present in your mobile so whatsapp is application so whatsapp is present in top layer camera is is a physical component that is present in your device how it will be embedded how they are connected by using this hardware abstraction layer so finally linux kernel so this is the hard part of this four layers so what is going to do with this linux kernel it is going to perform various management such as performance management power management security management so why that's why we call this as a art part of your mobile app so if you divide these five layers first layer deals with applications so application can be categorized into two categories system applications and user application so next java api framework it's nothing but the various features of the services how your application can use those services so next native c plus plus library and android runtime c plus plus library means it's nothing but the device drivers which are required to make use of the features that are available in my phone along with the android runtime we are going to make use of dvm it's nothing but dalvik virtual machine so hardware abstraction layer as i mentioned earlier there might be wide variety of hardware components there might be different sensors or different components which will be available in your mobile how those components can be used by using this hardware abstraction layer your application can use those hardware components so the linux kernel it will be the art part of your android application so it which will perform various management such as power management memory management security management so those things will be taken control by this linux kernel this is the art part of this architecture so architecture can be divided into five layers as mentioned in this diagram so coming to versions so presently we are using android 12 as of as on 2022 the version that we are going to that we are using is android 12 so as per the syllabus as per the contents that is present in your syllabus so so firstly we started with honeycomb the version is 3.0 which was released in the year february 2011 next ice cream sandwich in october 2011 jelly bean in 12 2012. likewise we have wide variety of versions uh starting from 3.0 till 9.0 which is present in your syllabus so now we are using 12.0 okay so which is nothing but android p android r okay so what is this version sir why the key those people will keep on updating android versions so why because so if you don't update your android version means your device your smartphone or your smartwatch will not be compatible with the new application that going to emerge that's why you must update why because what are the some there might be some drawbacks or some failures or some missing features may be available in marshmallow which will be overcome by using nugget likewise they will keep on updating the android versions and unless until that reaches the saturation as of now it has not reached the saturation till the present version that we are using is android 12 so this is the api level so the minimum api level that we should now use in our devices is 28 or 29 so the minimum api level is 28 that you must have in your device while developing any application so these are the various versions the version started with anikum ice cream sandwich jelly bean kitkat lollipop marshmallow nugget oreo and pre so the presently using version is android 12 so now last with respect to this introduction this is the last topic that is what are the challenges that we will come across while developing the android applications first one is i guess you have seen new mobile up mobile phones where it is somewhat like a laptop where you can fold some mobile devices the screen orientation is big some mobile devices are screen as a screen orientation is very less so we need to your application the application that you are going to develop should accommodate this multi-screen world for example it might be a folding uh device or it may be straight or it may be horizontal it may be vertical so you cannot state that my application will work only for the devices with horizontal orientation my application will work only for the devices with four centimeter height six centimeter width such constraints you cannot find you cannot mention so your application the application that you're going to develop should fix that multi-screen world different devices with different screen orientation will appear but your application should fit that's the first challenge that appears while developing the android app development so next one getting the performance means the memory usage the power usage such thing should be considered while developing an application okay so your application should perform just i guess if you double if you open if your battery performance preferences in your devices it will show how many various applications have used your battery how consumed your battery power so such thing that thing should be considered why because i am running an application which consumes my 50 percent of battery means who is going to install your android app no one is going to use similarly keeping the code and user secure so this is the main main attribute out of out of this file that is so if someone is downloading your application someone is using your android app means they should be secure why because nowadays we are doing a transaction over our mobile phones using various uh uh applications such as phone pay google pay amazon pay okay so if the data or the transaction details are the details which are present in our mobile phone or the contact details or the multimedia details are fetched by my application means that will be a threat so please remember one thing the users the viewers who are we watching this video kindly download any mobile application for example if you are using android applications means android phones kindly download only the applications which are available in google play store so only for such application the security checks are being done for remaining application don't don't download or don't install any application directly in the form of apk file so that may help your device as well as that may get the data that is present in your device finally it should be compatible for example i am developing an application for nowaday advanced android 12 but it should be compatible with the previous version marshmallow or kitkat lollipop so you should you should not ignore the previous versions even you have to consider the previous version and you have to update the features to be compatible with the present version that's also one challenge whatever the application that you are going to develop should be compatible with the world users so finally understanding the market and the users as i mentioned earlier present the global market for mobile application is wonderful guys so 95 percent indians are using the smartphones okay so especially 95 smartphones with android operating system so this subject this subject will have a huge weightage and will be will be a great asset why because 95 percent users who are using smartphones are android based means just imagine how many applications will have all how many jobs will be created so that's the market of android applications presently in india with respect to world concerns 71 percent users are android based thank you [Music]"},{video_id:"7wMb9CHyOoc",title:"Topic 1 Introduction to Mobile Application Development Part 1",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wMb9CHyOoc",duration:899,transcript:"hello welcome today we'll start with the first chapter introduction to mobile applications development and Android we will cover the introduction to mobile including devices and application development we'll get to know a little bit about the history and evolution of mobile and also brief introduction to Android mobility is defined to be having the capability of being able to move or to be moved easily it is very important to get things moved easily therefore in order to get things move easily there are certain properties to mobile devices and these are what causing mobile application development to be slightly different compared to traditional applications writing on desktop based systems mobile devices are started to be commercialized in 1983 and this is how a mobile device look like back then it's very expensive heavy and very basic it only allows you to make calls and receive calls but as time continues to progress we see more interesting aspect added into the phones including text messages we have music and then we have simple applications today we are going into a smartphone era where mobile applications become more and more important and is easier for us to actually obtain various types of applications to get various types of job done besides that is also possible to actually have various type of mobile devices they're not just a phone this includes tablets music players cameras watches and of a wide variety of possible devices that can be programmed to be small light and portable generally there are some characteristic to mobility first is portability the most important aspect is that one can easily carry the device and bring it all around the place therefore the size and the weight of the device is usually small this is very important because it will affect the actual characteristics of the devices and also giving challenges to the developers in terms of writing applications that can work on such small devices besides that usability is also very important the mobile device should be usable by different type of people in different type of environments they should not be restricted to be used at only a certain location or certain setting but it can be useful all over the place they can be affected by use of characteristics environmental critics and device for a statistics functionality is also very important for the mobile devices mobile applications can provide functions so that they are such functionalities running on the mobile devices that the user can use it to get certain job done these mobile applications can be standalone and could also dependent on other systems or other users connectability is a very important part that makes mobile devices great the capability to connect to a different device distance away is very important there are three modes of connectivity one that allows connection to the back-end system all the time one that will connect to the back-end system intermittently throughout the period duration and one that never connects to use the back-end system therefore can be working totally offline and our mobile devices have certain features in general first for the processor is definitely going to be slower compared to any desktop devices that is actually being launched in the same time the main reason is to conserve battery power because of the size of the battery due to portability the processor cannot be too fast because it will be two batteries and some the battery consuming and therefore would not last long therefore processor speed is usually controlled to be lower than the average PCs or desktops in the past the processor speed can be extremely small but now most of the process has been a lot more decent and allowing a lot of tasks to be conducted in a much more normal manner and a more acceptable speed next is the operating system the operating systems in mobile devices are different compared to the standard operating systems that we use in desktop systems they are specifically designed to be used on mobile devices popular operating system in mobile includes Android iOS Windows Mobile which are the three players the display is also small because of the size of the device and some cheaper phones and cheaper mobile devices can have less powerful displays the memory size is also small it can go down to a few hundred kilobytes for some very basic devices up to a few gigabytes but generally not as good as what we get in desktops where we have a much higher maximum ram that we can add in the input is also made more challenged because of the size due to the smaller size we do not have a sophisticated keyboard or mouse and etc some of the devices may be designed to have a small keyboard that is physically attached to the device but due to the device size the keyboard is very small however this is not popular nowadays and most of them resort to using on-screen keypads cell phones smartphones that we have nowadays are generally using touchscreen as their input and therefore most of this typing are done using these small on-screen keyboard that is made available on the touchscreen some will use handwriting recognition system to help assist writing more complicated characters such as Chinese Korean Japanese Hindi and other scripts that are a little bit more difficult to type voice input were also more popular compared to desktop applications to help assist in easier input mobile devices generally have a mean to connect to different type of networks and there are a few ways of connection including Wi-Fi 3G 4G and etc according to devices for extensibility of mobile devices they can be designed to have additional memory files modems cameras GPS however it depends on the mobile device itself during design phase and after that is quite difficult to custom-made an actual device according to users need so most of these are pre-designed but it is free for the manufacturers to control what to be added into a device during the design phase the price can be highly variable depending on the specifications of these device so it can be very cheap and very basic to very expensive phones with very good features and also very good specifications for the wireless networks it first started to be developed by Bell Labs advanced mobile phone services were designed back then but today most of us are using the global system for mobile communication gsm for our basic basic services that are provided by the service providers for receiving calls and also to make calls the basic way to connect to internet on mobile devices is to use the GPRS general packet radio service this is highly available throughout most regions and even in certain areas they are very rural or even in forested areas although signals could be unstable in very remote areas this is a very slow connection but at least a basic one that allows us to connect to internet when there are no better technology why then wipe and CDMA provides us 3G technology and these definitely increases the data transmission rate and is widely available in most major cities and larger towns today and this is one of the most important basic technology for us to connect an Internet in most urban and suburban areas there are some other wireless technologies and 4G technology is one of the most important technology that we are looking at today for basic mobile networking that we are using in a lot of larger cities this is a comparison of roughly where are the speed limits of the different technology 4G including LTE can actually theoretically go up to 1 Gbps there are different types of fields in mobile that we can actually try to classify a lot of these are duplicated with one another and overlapping so the first term that we often hear is mobile computing mobile computing allows us to have devices being programmed to be functioning and they are allowed to be move around so most of other phones that we are seeing today can be considered as a mobile computing device it allows actions to be done that are actually computed and you can use it in different locations as you bring the device along we also see anywhere anytime information this is the idea that allows us to get information wherever we go and with the basic connection that we have nowadays it is possible for us to obtain these thought of information as long as we are connected to the Internet the virtual home environment allows us to experience network that is similar to a home network a whole network usually have fixed IP so when we are moving around as we move our connection may be connected to different mobile mobile services tower and we did not experience the shift of this kind of connection and we will feel that we are always connected to a same connection and this is the most important part of mobile devices that allows us to experience such a kind of it network experience that is similar to where we are at a home or office environment and other type of fields and some of the important ones that we are seeing includes pervasive computing pervasive computing is getting important because we are seeing more and more technology going to be more pervasive in a way such as they are appearing in our cars it can appear in our clothing it can appear in some chairs tables and different common objects around us when this kind of pervasive computer"},{video_id:"2fp4K21Hsy8",title:"Introduction of Mobile Apps - Android App Development Course in Hindi #1",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fp4K21Hsy8",duration:697,transcript:`Welcome you new era of Android app development and now we will become "Android Kay Champion" Guys Mobile apps are more useable than websites. If you don't believe then here I ask a question that when was the last time you went to facebook.com and used Facebook? Here, let me ask another question whether you last used Facebook through website or mobile app, then the answer given by most of the students here will be mobile apps because in today's time more people use internet, mobile phone. If the internet goes down then the website closes at that very moment and we do not get to see any information on the internet. On the other hand, if we talk about the app, we are simply using it inside the phone. The things are already loaded, so we can easily see them even after going to the internet, after that there are some books, after that there is a recipe app or something similar to it, it starts mostly offline, so we can access it through the app. All information can be easily accessed. On average, if we see that a person spends 3 hours and 15 minutes a day on a mobile phone and on an average, a person checks his phone 58 times a day again and again and every One in every mobile phone user spends four to 4.5 hours on the mobile phone and you will be surprised to hear that on weekends, humans use less phones. Aaj compare tu week des [Music] To gas if the audios of the smartphone are seen. So it is very much and people use the phone regularly. Now we have two options here that they should not use this mobile phone, time is wasted on the mobile phone, after that the ice gets spoiled and blah blah while others. On the number here, we can see it as an opportunity that the more people are calling it, then we will create such a thing that if people start using our app, then why not we can benefit through that and we If we can earn good money then here we are going to see it further as a developer, so we are going to count this thing above, at this time if we look at the whole world then there is eight billing population whereas there are 6.6 billion smartphones in this world. If you exist in India, then gas here, if you target even one million audience according to you, then you can easily reach 10 thousand dollars from Punch, so if you want to see this as an opportunity here, then gas all this fund. To understand, we have launched Android App Development Course Using Kota Clean, so in this video we will see what types of mobile apps are there, why do we need mobile apps, the types of mobile apps that we will see are also on user end. We will also see the developer end pay, after that here we will also understand the difference between native app and hybrid apps and after that here we are going to do native development, so we will also see the benefits of native app development in detail, after that we will look at the career options. We will see whether it has any scope or not, if there is salary then how much can it be, then the first topic here is that we need mobile apps. In today's time, mostly people access the internet through smartphones. And whatever we are doing on the mobile phone, we are doing the same to the apps. Mobile apps provide easy and functional access to information, products and services to the users, which means whatever we need on the internet, it is there. Simply on our single click we go with the help of mobile app, so here I have given three words to it - information products and thirdly, it is services, so first let us know a little about them because knowing about these three is important here . This is going to be very important, so the first point that we will understand here is information, so humans are always interested in knowing about new things. For example, if I am on YouTube, then I have to create the setup of YouTube. I need to know that this You will get this at the rate of the mic, this is the stand for the mic, where will you get it, there is computer lighting, here if you see, this color is ok, then where will you get this, so if you want to know about all these things, then first of all I If I Google this app, I will get a lot of information from it. If you are a student then you have to do it in April or if you want to create a website then you should have a computer or laptop. Now you have to know which laptop or laptop I have. If I want to buy a computer, which mail will be right, then for that also it is a simple thing, you will just do Google, after that if you want to do any course, then it is a simple thing, you will go to Coursera and fly to it or you will do some other household work. Yes, it's a simple thing That too, if you search on the internet, then people may watch its tutorial, you may find it on YouTube itself, then we come to know that if we need any information, then for that we have to use the mobile app, so here The second point is the powder, before this we have got information about the help of YouTube, we need a mic, we need a camera, we need a computer, we need lighting, so these are all the products, now we have to buy these products. So for that we can go to Amazon or Flipkart. If you also have to buy anything in the same way, then you are ordering it through some or the other mobile app. After that, the third thing is services. There are many types of services in the services. For example, if you look at these apps like Ola, Uber, Zomato, they are providing services. Similarly, if you are a freelancer, you are also providing services, then for this also you would be using some mobile or Facebook. Yes, why do we need mobile apps? Let us take some examples from our daily life. In the morning, when we are sleeping, the world is also an alarm for us, the alarm is also a mobile app and when we sleep, YouTube is for us. It is telling that brother, go to sleep now, it is time for you to sleep. YouTube is also an app, so now let us see in a little more detail which mobile apps we use from morning to evening. Let's take it and on her wedding night, if you are a businessman or a student, then now let us know a little about which apps you use to do it, then the gas starting is happening with your own comfort, that means saliva has given us the place. So after that we have to do communication in a day, so for that we will do WhatsApp, Messenger, Telegram, we can do Zoom, we can do Skype for meetings, so for communication right now we are here. For socializing, we use more mobile apps. Now we use mobile apps because now after Covid, if seen, more people are more proud. So for that we use LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok. And I don't want to say it but people also use dating apps, so gas is there, now I talked about Instagram, WhatsApp and many other social media apps, so we have to store their status and download videos too, so gas is there for all these. For this we have uploaded an app on Play Store regarding My Status Ever, you can download it and you can download everything quick quick quick if you have to go to school, go to university, go to college or go to your relative's house. So then you will do it on Google Map, now only in free time, if you have something to do, now for that also we read some book or we play games etc. Mostly we are studying online for education. When we go to university or college, we get apps from their portals etc. for registration, there too there is less mobile app, after that humans also need some entertainment, so for internet we use YouTube for that. There are some music apps, we do that, we watch gym tutorials, we get apps, we get life hacks, if you want to watch something then YouTube, you will do it, if there is any window for example, you have to crack it because mostly people do not do the original, it is okay. You should do the original thing but its tutorial group is also on YouTube. If you are hungry then you want to eat fast food then it is a simple thing, you will go to Foodpanda if you want to eat desi food which is your favorite restaurant. So they must have some mobile app on which you can order. If you are an organized person then you will also have some todo app on which you can scrutinize your meetings. You can also make a time table, after that if You are a calculated person, meaning if you have a job , you have a fixed salary, so you have to spend your entire month within it, so for that you download some account type apps. If you are a poster student. If yes, then your experience will be very good because there is a lot of need for calculation. If you are a business owner, if you have to track your employers, then you should know how much of your items are in the inventory and which ones are out of the inventory. Which item is being bought, i.e. which sale is taking place, after that we have to give a receipt to the customer, all this is now done only through mobile apps. If you are an investor, then also you can use mobile apps. You do it because you have kept all your portfolio at one place, for that we get different apps on Play Store. If you invest in crypto, then you must know about finance, about coin base. You must be aware of many more things from the mobile app, from which I come to know that whatever we are doing almost has a role of mobile app in it, it plays a role at some place or the other, not only this, if you are religious then there is no When a religious event is about to take place, you also get a reminder from the app itself. In the matter of gas, we come to know that whatever we are doing in our daily life, our Sam is actually reading from some app or the other. Even if we are walking, all the steps we are taking are also being calculated, so as long as the mobile app will continue to be there, it is the scope of the mobile app developer, so gas, this video was getting quite long, so it The next topic that you are going to get, you will get it at this place. In this video, we will cover the types of mobile apps and will also know about native and hybrid apps in detail. This much is available in this video. Next in the video. Till then take care with the topic and thanks for watching needs`},{video_id:"Di074L1GXTo",title:"Code Mobile – iOS, Android or Cross-platform development. Which is which?",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di074L1GXTo",duration:2360,transcript:"[Music] so today we have christian muru he'll be taking us through android ios platform which which is which any questions we have he'll be taking us through all those things so i think i can now welcome christian to continue he is a software developer at codex for africa and also a cto at ventures yeah christian um i'm christian moro i'm a software developer so at college africa and the cgi adventures so today we're going to talk about android ios and cross-platform mobile application development so we are on reaches so i think uh it's pleasure you guys to be on board today with you and i'm actually glad for the host and all the organizers so let's go to the mobile development platforms so actually we have native that's ios so ios we can do objective c or swift then we have android android not necessarily java but you can do android actually with c plus plus you can do android with golang you can do android with flutter depending on your preference but also there is for windows phone that's c hash and xaml so for web there is those the normal languages that we all know that's html5 etc has written on the presentation so we have the hybrid and the cross platform but um i'm going to that quickly on the android so like for android there are different applications that are going to run maybe it's a web app or it's going to run on the play store so we can have like a simple app that has home contacts phone and browser etc but also there are number of application frameworks that you can use like the activity manager telephony manager resource manager content providers location etc there are very many actually but also it's good to know the libraries that you can use in your android development so we have the surface manager the free type ssl sgl opens hello okay so yeah those are libraries and we also have the linux kernel for those who are beginners perhaps they could have gone through about the linux scanner that linux kernel actually it's got like when somebody or a user is installing that application for android you can ask you maybe to access your camera your contacts it will ask you maybe even to access your and message messages etc so all those they're done on the linux scanner like when you see an application like uber can access your location can access your you can access your contacts etc your camera as well so you can imagine like let's say loan applications those are android ones like um tala actually they will access mobile phone contracts they will access your location etc because they'll need to know where you are at at a point that you haven't paid your loan in advance that's why now they can send contacts because they are already you have given them access to your mobile contacts okay so we have the power management etc okay i think we are good to go actually um guys uh this session i i really i really love it to be an interactive session whereas you guys will be asking me questions as well as i'll be answering to you and if i have any other question for you guys you can come back and answer me okay so let's go to the cross platform so actually uh there's that way which you need now to build a high quality native apps so it's not very hard actually but it depends on how you're going to use it so the alternatives for your [Music] across platform could be native script react native zamarin you can even use kotlin you can use java etc depending on your preference so um on the cross platforms guys we have different frameworks that are used to build cross-platform applications so we have like jquery that's mobile app mobi marmalade titanium phone gap essential accenture monocross we have more thing i build up even mit can do that i hope guys we're together so um is there anyone maybe with any question perhaps at that point as i continue right quietness means that we are flowing well all right so let's go to the native script so actually it's around time for building and running magic ios android and soon windows phone apps with a single javascript code base so actually it depends on how you're going to use it so um let's see on the features so it's created and supported by generic fully open source actually yeah native speakers and open source so it uses v8 on android and javascript core on ios engines it uses existing js and css xml html skills it also uses es6 and track script and angular restricted css support first public better releases so that was it's better so uh the first and let's say the genesis of native script it started on the uh fifth of march 2015 that was so it was version one i'm now back so i was talking about the native script and uh we're actually getting to know about native script and how it goes so i said it's a random for building and running native ios android and soon windows phone apps with single javascript code base that is so it was created and supported by telerik that's the genesis of native script so it uses v8 on android and javascript called ios engines it uses existing gis and the css xml or html skills but again there is genesis weight so it started on 5th of march 2015 that was when it released a better one a better release that is version one okay so let's go to react native let's get to know it so red native lets you build mobile apps using only javascript it uses the same design as react letting you compose a rich mobile ui and declarative components so this is the point whereas by each it actually gives you an interactive interface whereas by maybe a user can interact with it very well and quickly without any contradictions in between it so it's up an open source javascript library the react native so it's actually an open system for javascript libraries and as you know there are a number of libraries actually which are coming from a certain language like react comes from javascript we have now denon which is coming from like it's a daughter from node.js we again have a next js which comes from vjs so actually the number of i mean a number of libraries that coming from specific javascript not javascript but a library a specific languages that is so the facebook ad manager on ios and android that share 85 percent of the code so it depends but now we can see red native it actually grows perpetually and we like have 500 plus companies and developer who publishes up on apple app store using react native so actually reg native is also one of the flaming languages that we have is currently in the industry so we again have xamarin actually submarine it uses the dotnet framework and as we all know we've talked about the libraries that are ref native which is a javascript library and um submarine is a donate dot net library whereas by it also uses flutter flatter also uses the dot net so the marine brings open source they don't need to mobile development enabling every developer to build truly native apps for any device in c hash and f so if hash that's flat up i hope you get me guys there anyone with any question okay uh the mute means that we are flowing well right so let's go to the xamarin architecture choices so um as we said is that i'm going to speak about android ios and cross platform so we can see on the ios may be using ch user interface on the android exam and windows same way so it actually shares the same apology so like um let's say like for example they have used c hash but they're another long there's another language like flutter flutter actually it has um let's use the interface and actually it uses the net framework as well and it can work on both android and ios and actually after you guys have learned java on android you'll find it more easy when you learn when you'll find it more easy when you learn flatter because flat actually it's got a lot of framework and it's very quick and without a lot of chords so actually when you use flat and you it's only be the golang and quarantines it will be very quick for you guys but again that those who love using kotlin and java only for android especially the beginners you know they normally flow from coach lane and java which is okay right but also we have the xamarin phones uh so they also use uh shared app logic as well but xamarin ios and xml android they have like 60 to 80 percent code reuse so like it's like let's say you have used xamarin on your android when you're moving to ios app development i you will definitely not add some tons of codes but you will only add like 20 percent of the xamarin codes to fit you in the ios app development i hope guys you get me actually i wrote the recommend the recommended so it's actually recommended for sophisticated ux app that's user experienced up is anyone asking questions okay so we uh we have summary informs as i said is that they're also they also share up logic but up to 99 percent code reuse so actually xamarin forms it it uses lag largest code reuse that is 99 and actually it's most recommended for forms based lob apps okay so let's go for xamarin under the hood so that's uh let's go on the ios architecture that is so ios that's when you have your app as we i previously said on the android part is thereby it uses the car name but now here this one um it uses the your app rpa whereby in ios you use swift at most like in android you'll develop your android application using android studio but actually on the ios you definitely use swift then now you decide to use maybe code igniter you can use xamarin you can use react native flat as well whereby now you you won't have to add some tons of code if you have uh developed that application from android i hope guys you get like let's say uber for example i'm using um mainly uber because i know they are popular applications that they are around and actually their users keeping on flaming each day and out so um let's say uber they they have the same ux and their ui actually looks similar from android to ios so actually it's just the same way so what they use there the up the app logic is just the same way they used on the ios as well so they just added very little codes like maybe 20 to 30 percent from what they were developing from android okay so actually on ios they have also the swift is like unix like canal for those who have been interacting with fifth but uh it actually uses a full aot monorantine so you can either use it you can build ios up using ci or dot net appears so dot net api is there a lot actually you can use flutter.net you can use c-hash.net etc there are a lot actually okay so we're still in the xamarin under the hood so let's go to the android architecture now so this is where now you take the dot net apis now you go to the android binding after you have done with the binding you now go to the android that's where now you start building your application so maybe you can build you up now with java like i said in the ios that i used an example of c hash for example but flutter works from both and actually as i said is that flat is one of the flaming languages that's coming up and anyway it's supported with google as well okay so um now you go to the java after there now you do the art once you have you have your ad an ad actually it's an idea about what you want to develop like maybe you are developing an application that you will use would be used to sell motor vehicles etc but again now you go to the acw now those are the procedures or the journey towards android application using xamarin actually so from mcw you go to scw then mono and all of them they use linux kernel so as i said is that linux kernel is what gives the users uh permissions so the user before installing application it will ask him or her some permissions perhaps like to access phone camera messages from contracts etc etc yeah that's it so let's do a quick comparison i actually decided to do this this comparison because it's quite good actually and very logic in debugging your application now so i just used native script react native and xamarin all of these they're actually the dotnet frameworks but also flutter is a dot-net framework so let's go like debugging on emulator so um native script and you can debug it on emulator react native yes you can debug it on the emulator xamarin of course yes native rest native native native script you can debug it on device you can debug it on react native again native script sorry you can debug it on the device react narrative you can debug it on the device as well zamarin you can debug it on the device uh but also there is this remote uh debugging like for native uh native script yeah you can you can do its debugging uh remotely using the link that is just sent there so you just debug it from there react native as well you can debug it uh that's a sample there from facebook and also xamarin you can't so xamarin you can do remote debugging for it and let's go to live reload now when you want to reload your application let's say now so with the native script you can reload the application with react native of course you can live reload it and with xamarin you can but only in xaml because xml previewer for xamarin.forms alpha that is i hope you guys get me right anyone with any question perhaps as we continue okay i'm happy guys i hope um we are all flowing well we are all flowing well no questions okay let me get done then uh i'll be getting back to the questions okay so let's go now to the comparison about the features now because now we are done with the comparison on the debugging that is um android ios and cross platform so we are now going to compare the features so like native script on the ios version support io7 that is but actually now we are even on the ios 10 which is the latest release that is so io7 or greater and xcode version 3 than 6 on the rec native it does on the ios 8.0 plus and then xamarin it does on ios 6.1 or high we also have native script which on the main android version support it does on the 17 version 4.2 which also on the react native it does on the android on the version 4.1 plus that is an api 16 also we can go to xamarin which it does on the android 4.0 0.3 that's api 15 or higher again we have native script that is on windows phone support so native skill um that time it was not yet but now they were actually working towards having it working on the android phone uh rec native official not microsoft community supported but some are in its is a native script so let's say the features that it supports like camera sensors touch id iris etc so it does on the camera location and plugins recognitive it does on the camera location plugins as well and xamarin does camera location and some xamarin plugin actually there are several there are a number of them so let's go to the native map support on the mapping now like um i don't know but i keep repeating about uber because it uses maps as well so i think it's a good epitome for our case yeah so uber it actually uses um a native maps that's when you get a driver gets to know your location and then it comes to pick you up right so erect native of course it's is it has some native map and xamarin of course it's is i hope you guys understand me okay comparison now on the deployment so we have done a comparison on the debugging comparison of the features and now we're going to the comparison on the deployment so we have the native script we are still comparing native script react native and xamarin so native script that's for android direct native ios submarine for cross platform so automated tests yes it does some automated tests you can you you can check some uh samples on those links that hit gps docs.nativescape.org for slash tooling for slash testing so we have some automated test that rpm you can get it at https forward slash github.com vs native script uh we have rec native yes it does the automatic test on the link below our screen you can find it there xamarin as well it does but not your script on the deployment without market it doesn't recognize if it does xamarin doesn't as well um native script on the easy deployment and continuous integration that is you keep on integrating some more features etc so of course it does so all of them native script react native and xamarin they allow you to do some extra more deployments like let's say now you have deployed your application you want to update it from version one that maybe you are the better version now you've started it and you want now to take it to version two etc you're going or maybe 1.1 etc the way you might prefer it okay then we have the packet side that's apk and that's maybe 21.8 mega mega megabytes on android and bandwidth with webpack we have an app ipa with 39.9 mbs that's on iphone and bandwidth webpack apk so it's they actually keep on fluctuating so we have also apk on rec 90 we have apk 8.47 on android and ipa 7.5 mb on iphone so that's how they keep on interchanging and i as i said is that while you coded maybe you've programmed your android application and now you're going to ios maybe android you would have used a 60 of your code now you only have to add some twenty percent of the sixty percent so that you program it to be an ios application as well with the same features the same ui and just the same ads etc okay so xamarin in apk 16 mb's on android and up 46.4 mb's on ios that's it um this actually an error here so i'm sorry guys i think i'm coming to my conclusion so i'm christian moore those are my contacts that's my email i have a number of mails guys but uh you can use any else you can accept me or call me at that contact if you need me to share more i also share more resources from pluralsight anyway um i uh i mentor the google africa developer scholarship 2020 learners so i have those resources as well and also i declared some more resources from proverbs 8 recently where i keep on sharing them especially on the codextra whatsapp platform for kenya that is thank you very much guys and stay in touch i'm ready to listen from you i think i've taken 35 minutes for the next 25 or maybe 10 let's let me get to hear from you guys yes thank you so much i have a question yes please since this is like an introduction an introductory session on all the different types so do you have maybe any resources how did you even start into first place even into mobile development you have like plans okay yeah of course so um i have i have i have like tons of resources um from pluralsight for mobile web specialists android app and jquery and react for ios as well i got them for swift so actually i prefer pluralsight proceed have some very nice uh very nice resources for you guys to learn yeah actually pro site can do better but also you can learn like let's say now you want to learn a you can you can type developers.google.com so you just search that http www.developers.google.com that you will actually find some quite good stuff there to learn for free like a lot of resources for you guys to learn on development and actually flutter as i said is that it's actually good because it works on android ios and cross platform yeah any other question please [Music] please can you hear me we hear you man i can't be kindly while asking your question please tell me your name um i'm calling and uh i have a question how how did you get to specify because like choose the platform now sorry sorry collins i can't hear you well i just told you about uh just your name and introduction brief introduction finally come again what [Music] what made you choose it the rest okay okay nice i will say thank you collins for your questions actually that's a nice question for me um actually guys uh learning is actually a continuous process and i simply started from the very common and regular used language html css forever that that's the language which people use it and i specified on html css javascript and php long time ago a bit so thereafter now i went deep to react once i went to react now i decided to do an android application as well using react and thereafter now i decided to use the code igniter on my android part so on the amount of using react that's when now i shifted to the ios so ios i also use the react native and it took me well but now i just came to realize about flutter oh wow so this flutter it's like i'm falling in love with it because i just caught with it and i love it this flutter i just like its ui so it's a matter of you doing one language you master it ensure that what you can build with c hash you can as well build it with c plus ensure what you can build it with react on web you can actually build it on android application as well and be sure of yourself that's what most needed of you the number of resources for you to learn you can go to um pluralsight free code.com um especially during this time you can go to um solo land et cetera there are a lot there are a lot there a lot and actually codextra we're working towards giving some more free learning uh resources a few such skills www.skills.codextra africa.com you will be able to see what we are currently developing yeah okay thank you welcome collins any other questions [Music] i'm not sure if you have any other questions [Music] so we have we have a guest it's called jeremiah jeremiah can you meet yourself and tell us and if you have any question or anything on your mind or we'll get into the session and can you kindly recommend for the best ide for the beginner who can want to develop the android apps [Music] hey i don't feel like recommending for you guys but you can use any id as long as it meets your letter your specification it actually depends it's the matter of you while you are developing your app and what about android studio it's calling again if he wants to develop an android app isn't android studio one of the best developers like development for the development ideas for android actually ids are a lot we have android studio but actually android studio is what it's currently being used a lot and it's very nice there's also eclipse apache cordova we have up inventor for android we have eclipse qt so qt actually uses mostly python for those who are python developers also there is windows app studio but all these just came on the way me i just looked at them but i i got rid of them i just went to android studio so till today i just used android studio you hello jeremiah i actually yeah okay if you're using java i can recommend for you android studio android studio can be of great help for you especially on your ide yeah it's actually the best idea for that okay thank you welcome welcome thank you so much for that so i'll call out one of the last person before we end or if you have if you have any questions you can understand with yourself so maybe i can call on to cindy um [Music] wrap up [Music] um what i can say or an advice to any developer currently is that you guys learn how to speak on one language don't just come here about a new language like now there's amber a lot of languages just are popping up they know js so like guys are just popping up a swear rush to those new languages no just stick to one language just stay tuned get to know it very well don't mix up languages so that you become self-sufficient with one language first then you go to another one that's my advice to all developers and cheers guys thanks for coming [Music]

bases curtains artwork and Home Furnishings he requires a software application that would allow the customers to browse the available products at their fingertips and buy them online Adam eager to jump into his new business wanted to understand how the software development process works to start with his business idea Adam meets his cousin Mark who is a software developer and a good one at it he pitches his idea and asks his cousin to help him design an online business application Mark explains to Adam the way of Designing the best online shopping application we need to understand the working of the software development lifecycle also known as the sdlc it involves distinctive phases to initiate the software production based on the client requirements further Mark briefs Adam about the six crucial phases of sdlc in designing any software application planning requirements phase requirement analysis phase designing phase implementation phase testing phase deployment and maintenance phase the development team will commence production post agreeing on the terms and conditions discussed between the client and the development team regarding all the proceedings and requirements initiating the production with the planning requirements phase where the client and the development team will discuss the basic requirements for the software like the purpose of the application the details about the end user of the product key elements like format and attributes of the application for Designing and the overall user interface's design of the software the development moves on to the second stage the requirement analysis phase which includes the detailed information about each element to design the software is discussed validating the installation of elements in the application according to the client's requirements calibrating the security protocols and Performing risk analysis for the software application and all the discussed details are then to be filed in the software requirements specification document also known as the SRS document after completing the second phase third stage of software development the design phase the software designers will devise the system design following the SRS document the system design defines the overall architecture of the software and checks its feasibility with the client's requirements all the details of the design phase are added to the design document specification also known as the DDS document and shared with the analysts and stakeholders for review next the development moves on to the fourth stage the coding or implementation phase in the coding phase the developers start writing the code using the languages they choose for the software development the coding stage is also one of the most important phases as it encapsulates the implementation of the software product the developers use predefined guidelines and development tools like compilers and debuggers to implement the code the next phase of the production is where we begin with the fifth stage of software development the testing phase the develop software is now deployed in multiple test environments to check the functioning of all the attributes in the software architecture after the test cases are completed the quality assurance and the testing team may find errors or bugs in the software which will be forwarded to the developer team for debugging this testing and debugging process continues until the software is stable and works per the required specifications as for the last stage in the sdlc life cycle the deployment and maintenance phase is initiated with the testing phase completed the software application is ready for deployment and consumer use in this phase the development team will set up links for the application and make it accessible to the users after the deployment is completed and users begin using the application they may encounter an error or a bug in the application which is to be solved from time to time maintenance also includes releasing application updates and enhancements for the software for better performance and user experience Adam at this point was surprised by all the effort and steps taken by the development team to design a software application and the key phases involved in sdlc and on that note here's a question for you all what does the design

are five essential skills let's go over them one by one there are basically two ways to build mobile apps native or crossplatform with Native development we can build an app that runs only on a particular platform like iOS or Android this approach gives us full control over the capabilities of the target platform resulting in great performance and the best user experience however the downside is that if you want to build the same app for a different platform form we have to create a separate project in an entirely different language and ecosystem this means two separate projects and two sets of bugs to fix that's where crossplatform or multiplatform development comes to the rescue with crossplatform development we can reduce development Time by reusing the same code for different platforms and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug once means it's fixed across multiple platforms now for Native development we have a few options for iOS we can use Objective C which is an older language or Swift which is modern and preferred for Android we can use Java which is a traditional language or cotland which is modern and preferred for crossplatform development the option depends on the framework or toolkit we use there are several crossplatform toolkits like react native flutter cotland multiplatform Maui and a few others let's dive into each one first off we have react native which was released by Facebook in 2015 this toolkit lets you build mobile apps using JavaScript and and react which is a popular library for building web user interfaces some big names using react native include Microsoft Office scype and even Facebook itself then we have flut which is a Google product that came out in 2017 flut uses a programming language called Dart which takes the best parts of JavaScript Java and C some examples of apps built with flutter are eBay Alibaba and Google pay it's really powerful and gaining a lot of traction now let's talk about cotland multiplatform this is the newest player released by jetbrains the same company behind tools like intellig pycharm and webstorm in my opinion the best idees in the world it uses the cotlin programming language which is a modern language inspired by Java apps like McDonald's Netflix and cash app are built with cotton multiplatform finally we have Maui which stands for net multiplatform appui introduced by Microsoft Maui allows you to build native mobile and desktop apps using C and . net these days most companies prefer to use multiplatform development to reduce their costs this means we can rule out native development for now and focus on cross-platform options now which framework is the best well there is no such a thing as the best framework yes there are people out there like our Superstar highly opinionated developer Mr John Smith who swears by react native but there are others with a different opinion the reality is that neither of these Frameworks is perfect each has its own problems and quirks that you you will discover once you start building real applications Beyond YouTube tutorials and the reason for that is that they try to support two entirely different platforms at the same time so which crossplatform solution should you choose well it depends on two things first on what languages and Technologies you're familiar with for example if you're a c developer Maui might be the easier route if you know web Technologies like JavaScript and react you might want to go for react native it's an easier transition from web to mobile development the other factor is job opportunities there are often more jobs available for react native and flutter here you can see the number of open positions for different types of mobile app developers in the US now this is the current situation here and maybe different where you live maybe there are more job opportunities for a flutter developer so I recommend doing your own research rather than taking my or someone else's advice about which route to choose but realistically if you're looking for a career in Mobile development you would have to choose between react native and flutter if you have basic web development skills react native is a better route otherwise I would recommend flutter because Dart which is the programming language that flutter uses is a nicer language to work with than JavaScript it's more modern and doesn't have the quirks and weird Parts you find in JavaScript so decide between JavaScript or Dart and commit to a study plan I believe if you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can learn the essence of either of these languages in about 2 months to help you on this journey I've created a free supplementary PDF that breaks down the specific Concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned it's a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description Box by the way I have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if you're looking for structur learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a Version Control System them like git git is not a programming language it's a tool we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and GitHub which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer now git has a ton of features but you don't need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80% of the time you use 20% of git's features 1 to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running now building mobile apps often involves working with data structures and implementing complex algorithms this is where a lot of self-taught programmers struggle because they try to skip ahead and learn more and more languages and tools without learning the fundamentals of computer science data structures and algorithms are critical subjects taught to computer science students and they're often covered in Tech interviews especially at big companies like apple Google and Microsoft while you can skip this step and go to the next as someone who has had the privilege of teaching millions of people I highly recommend you not to overlook this step otherwise you're going to feel the pain later in your career so spend 1 to 2 months studying classic data structures and algorithms this will give you a strong foundation in programming and problem solving the next thing I would recommend learning which again a lot of self-taught developers Miss is design patterns design patterns are proven solutions to Common software design problems there are 23 classic design patterns documented in the book design patterns by the gang of four many of these patterns are used in Mobile Frameworks so learning them will give you a deeper understanding of object-oriented design principles and how these mobile Frameworks work under the hood now I have to tell you this book is pretty old and written in C++ honestly it's a difficult read because many of the examples in the book are dry and not quite relevant to Modern software that's why I've created a very Hands-On and pragmatic course on this topic where I use Java and modern examples found in applications we use every day you can see how design patterns are used to solve problems in modern applications whether you want to take my course or use a different resource I believe if you dedicate a few hours every day you can have a pretty solid understanding of design patterns in about 2 months all right the next thing you need to learn is a mobile framework which we talked about before for Dart you should learn flutter and for JavaScript you should learn react native assuming you have a solid background in programming you can learn either of these Frameworks in about 2 months so if you dedicated a few hours every day and follow this road map you'll have the necessary knowledge to apply for an entry-level mobile developer job in about 8 to 12 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below I'll do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos If you enjoyed this video please give it a like And subscribe for more useful

to data structures and algorithms. We are going to learn today some basic terminology
regarding data structures and the notations that you would be following in the rest of
this course. We will begin with some very simple definitions. An algorithm which is
an outline of the steps that a program has to take or any computational procedure has
to take. A program on the other hand is an implementation of an algorithm and it could
be in any programming language. Data structure is the way we need to organize the data, so
that it can be used effectively by the program. So you are all familiar with certain data
structures, an array or a list for instance. In this course you will be seeing a lot more
data structures in this course and you will see how to use them in various algorithms.
We will take a particular problem, try to solve that problem and in the process develop
data structures, the best way of organizing the data, associated with that problem. What
is an algorithmic problem? An algorithmic problem is essentially, that you have a certain
specifications of an input as is given here and you specify what the output should be
like. And a specification of an input could be, here is one specification, a sorted, non
decreasing sequence of natural numbers of non-zero, finite length. That's an input,
that's a completely specified input. I have given 2 examples here of inputs which meet
the specification and I have not given any output specification yet here. Now what is an instance? These are 2 instances
of the input. This is the specification for the input and you can have any possible instance,
you can take any sequence of sorted, non-decreasing numbers and that would form an input instance.
So there are many input instances possible here. An algorithm is essentially, describing the
actions that one should take on the input instance to get the output as desired, as
is specified. And again there can be infinitely many input instances and there can be infinitely
many algorithms for solving certain problem. Each one of you could do it in a slightly
different way. That brings the notion of good algorithm.
If there are so many different algorithms for solving a certain problem, what is a good
algorithm? Good algorithm for us is an efficient algorithm. Anything that is efficient is good.
What is efficient? Efficient is something, which has small running time and takes less
memory. These will be the two measures of efficiency that we will be working with. There
could also be other measures of efficiency. But these are the only two things we would
be considering in this course. And most of our time we would be spending with the running
time really. Space, of course we will be analyzing the space and most of the time would be spent
in worrying about the running time of an algorithm. And we would be interested in the efficiency
of algorithms, as a function of the input size. So clearly you can imagine that, if I have
a small input and my algorithm running on that input or my program running on that input
will take less amount of time. If the input becomes 10 times larger, then the time taken
by the program would also grow. It may it becomes 10 times, may be it becomes 20 times
or may be it becomes 100 times, I do not know. It is this behavior of the increase in the
running time, with the increase in the size of input that would also be of our interest
to us. We will come to all of these in a short while as we go through these slides. How does one measure running time? So I said
efficiency, running time, very important. How does one measure the running time of an
algorithm? One way would be, I have put down here as an experimental study. You have a
certain algorithm and you have to implement that algorithm, which means you have to write
a program in a certain programming language. You run the program with varying data sets,
some smaller, some larger data sets, some would be of some kinds and some would be of
different kinds, so varying composition. And then you clock the time that the program takes
and clock does not mean that you should sit down near stopwatch. Perhaps you can use the
system utility like let's say System. Current Time Millis (), to clock the time that the
program takes and then from that you try and figure out, how good your algorithms is, so
that is what one would call an experimental study of the algorithm. This has certain limitations. So I put them
down. First you have to implement the algorithm to be able to determine how good your algorithm
is you have to Implement it and that is already a huge overhead, considerable amount of time
has to be spent in doing this. When your experiments can be done only on a limited set of inputs.
After all I said the number of instances is infinitely large and you can run your experiment
only on a small set of instances and that might not be really indicative of the time
that your algorithm is taking for other inputs, which you have not considered in your experiment. Further if you have two algorithms and you
have to decide, which one is better you have to use exactly the same platforms to do the
comparison. Platform I mean both the hardware and software environment. Because as you can
imagine, different machines would make a difference, not just different machines in fact even the
users who are working on that system at that particular point would make a difference on
the running time of an algorithm. It becomes very messy, if you have to do it this way. What we are going to do in the part of this
course, in fact in this very first lecture is to develop the general methodology, which
will help us to analyze running time of algorithms. We are going to do it as follows: we are going
to first develop a high level description of an algorithm, a way of describing an algorithm
and we are going to use this description to figure out the running time and not to implement
it to any system. A methodology would help us take into account
of all possible input instances and it would help us and also it will allow us to evaluate
the efficiency of the algorithm in a way that it is independent of the environment, independent
of the platform that we are using. I said we will give the high level description
of the algorithm. This very first point here, we will give a high level description. So,
what is this? So this brings me to what? We will call this Pseudo-code. And this is how we are going to be specifying
all our algorithms for the purposes of this course. Here is an example of pseudo code and you
might have seen this in your earlier courses also. What is this algorithm doing? This algorithm
takes an array A, which stores an integer in it and it is trying to find the maximum
element in this array. What I have written here is not a program because I think the
syntax is all wrong. But it is pseudo-code; it is a mixture of natural language and some
high-level programming concepts. I am going to use a for loop, do loop, I am
going to use if-then-else statement and I am going to use a while loop. But I will not
bother about whether there should be a semicolon here or there should be colon here and I am
not going to bother about those are things are required by the compiler but for our understanding
this is completely clear what this program is doing. So what it is doing? It is keeping
track of the maximum variable in a variable called current max which is initialized to
the first element of the array. And Then it is going to run through the remaining element
of the array, compare them with the current maximum element. Current Max ← A [0]. If
the current maximum element is less than the current element, then it would update the
current max. A[i] becomes the new max and then when the loop terminates we would just
return current max. If current Max < A[i] then current Max ← A[i]
return current Max It is a very simple algorithm but just with
this pseudo-code, you are able to understand what it is doing. This will not run on any
computer since it is the pseudo-code, but it conveys the idea or the concepts any question
up to this point? That is what I saying most structured pseudo code, most structured than
usual course but it is less for than formal programming. And How pseudo-code will look like? We will
use standard numeric and Boolean expressions in it. Instead of the assignment operator which is
'=' in java, I will use ← and instead of the equality operator, an equality relationship
in java which is '= =' the same in C, I will just use '='. I will declare methods with
the algorithmic name and the parameter it takes. Algorithm name (param 1, param2) I will use all kinds of programming construct
like if ...then statement, if ...then... [else] statement, while ... do, repeat ...until,
for ... do and to index array I will say A[i], A [i, j]. It should be clear in what it is
doing. I will use return when the procedure terminates
and return value will tell, what the value returned by the particular procedure or a
function. When I have to make a call to a method, I will specify that with the name
of the method and the argument and what is the object that is used. Any question to this
point. What was the object? This is specifies the type of the value returned
by the particular method. You will see more of this, when we come across more pseudo-code.
How do we analyze algorithms? First we identify what are the primitive operations in our pseudo-code.
What is a primitive operation? It is a low level operation. Example is a data movement
in ,I do an assignment from one to another, I do a control statement which is a branch
(if... then ...else) subroutine call or return. I do arithmetic operations or logical operations
these are all we called as a primitive operation. • Data movement (assign)
• Control (branch, subroutine call, return) • Arithmetic an logical operations (e.g.
addition, comparison) In my pseudo code, I just inspect the pseudo
code and count the number of primitive operations that are executed by an algorithm. Let us
see an example of sorting. You all know what sorting is, the input is some sequence of
numbers and output is a permutation of the sequence which is in non decreasing order.
What are  the requirements for the output? It should
be in non-decreasing order and it should be the permutation of the input. Any set of numbers which are in non-decreasing
order does not make an output. Algorithm should sort the numbers that were given to it and
not just produce the sequence of numbers as an increasing order. Clearly the running time
will depends upon, number of elements (n) and often it depends upon, how sorted these
numbers are. If they are already in sorted order then the algorithm will not take a long
time. It also depends upon the particular algorithm we use. The running time would depend
upon all these things. The first sorting technique we use is the one that you have used very
often. Let us say when you are playing game of cards. What is the strategy you follow, when you
are picking up a set of cards that have been dealt out to you? You like to keep them in
a sorted order in your hand. You start with the empty hand and you pick up the first card,
then you take the next card and insert it at the appropriate place. Suppose if I have some five cards in your
hand already, let us say 2, 7, 9, jack and queen. Then I getting 8, so I am going to
put it between 7 and 9. That is the right place it has to be placed in. I am inserting
it at the appropriate place and that is why this technique is called insertion sort. I
keep on doing this, till I have picked up all the cards and inserted in the appropriate
place. So this is the pseudo-code for insertion sort.
I will give an array of integers A contain input and output is a permutation of the original
numbers, such that it is sorted. The output is also going to be in the same array.
A [1]≤ A [2]≤ _ ≤ A[n] This is the input, output specification. I
am going to have 2 variables or indices i and j. The array is going to be sorted from
a [1] through a [j-1]. The jth Location is an element which I have to insert appropriately
to the right place Clearly j has to vary from 2 to n. For j ←2 to n I am going to look at jth element and I put
that in key. Key ←A[j] I have to insert A [j] or the key in to the sorted sequence
which is A [1] through A [j-1]. i.e. A [1_j-1] I am going to use the index i to do this.
What is index i going to do? Index i is going to run down from j-1 down to 1. We going to
decrease index i, which is what we are doing in here in this while do loop. It starts with the value j-1.And what I am
going to do? I have to insert 7 and I am going to move 9 to 7th location, because 9 is more
than 7. Then I compare 7 with 8 and 8 is still greater than 7, so I will move it right. Then
I compare 7 with 6. As 6 is smaller than 7,Now I found the right place for 7, I would put
7 here ,that exactly what is happening here. I run through this loop, till I find an element
which is less than key. Key is the element which I am trying to insert. This loop will
continue while the element, I am consider is more than key and this loop will terminate,
when I see an element which is less than key or the loop will terminate when I reach i=0.
While i >0 and A[i] > key do A [i+1] ← A[i] That means I have moved everything to the
right and I should insert the element at the very first place and what am I doing Here?
I am just shifting the element one step to the right. Do A [i+1] ← A[i] Note that I have to insert 7 at the right
place, so I shift 9 right to 1 step. 9th location becomes empty, then I shift 8 to 1 step, so
this 8th location becomes empty and now I can put 7 here. i + 1 is the index, which
would be the empty location eventually and i put the key there. A [i+1]← key All of
you can implement it. May be you would have implemented it in a slightly different way,
that would give you a different program, but the algorithm is essentially the same. You
are going to find the right place for the element and insert it.Now Let us analyze this
algorithm. I have put down the algorithm on the left
(There is a small mistake here there should be a left arrow Please make a correction on
that) .What we are going to do? A [i+1] ← A key
Let us count. Key ← A[j]
I ← j-1 These are all my primitive operations. Here
I have to do primitive operations, why because I am comparing i with 0 and I am comparing
A[i] with key, I am also taking and, so there are three primitive operations.
while i >0 and A[i] > key Each of the operation takes a certain amount
of time, depending upon the computer system you have.C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6 just Reflect or
just represent the amount of time taken for these operations and they can be in any units.
And here I am counting the number of times, each of these operations is executed is done
in this entire program. Why this operation is done n times? I start
by assigning j =2 then assign 3, 4,5,6,7 and go up to n. Then when I increment it once
and check that there is one more, so I have counted it as n times. There might be small
errors in n and n + 1, that is not very important. So this roughly n times we have to do this
operation. How about this operation? Key ← A[j] I am
going to do exactly n-1 times once for 2, once for3, once for 4 up to n. That is why
this operation is being done up to n-1 times. Just leave the comment statement. Again the
operation will be done exactly n-1 times. We have to look at how many times I come to
this statement. While I >0 and A[i] > key tj -reflects the Counts the number of times
I have to shift an element to the right, when I am inserting the jth card in to my hand.
In the previous example when I am inserting 7, I had to shift 2 elements 8 and 9. is going
to count that quantity and that is the number of times I am going to reach A[i] part of
my while loop. While I >0 and A[i] >key I will be checking this condition for many
times. For one iteration or for the jth iteration of this for loop, I am going to reach this
condition for tj times. The total number of times I am saying that condition is the sum
of tj as j goes from 2 to n. ∑nj=2 tj ,while I >0 and A[i] > key,
do A[i+1] ← A[i] Every time I see (A[i] >key) condition I also
come to A[i], I am going to be see this condition, I am going to come this statement one more
time then, I come here because you know the last time i see the statement I would exit
out of here. That is why this is tj -1 where j going from 2 to n.∑nj=2 (t j-1) A [i+1] ← A key. This statement here is
not a part of the while loop (this is an assignment operation please correct this). So this statement
is part of the for loop is done exactly n minus one times as the other statement. So
the total time this procedure takes if you knew what this constant work can be computed.
You do not know what tj is. tj is quantity which depends upon your instance and not problem
there is a difference here. Problem is one of sorting. The instance is a set of numbers,
the sequence of numbers that have given to you. Thus tj depends upon the instance. Let us see the difference that tj makes. If
the input was already sorted, then tj is always 1(tj=1). I just have to compare the element
with the last element and if it is larger than the last element, I would not have to
do anything. tj is always a 1 if the input is already in increasing order. What happens when the input is in decreasing
order? If the input is in decreasing order, then the number that I am trying to insert
is going to be smaller than all the numbers that that i already have because the input
is in decreasing order the number I am trying to insert is smaller than the numbers I have
sorted in my array .What am I going to do? I am going to compare with the 1st element,2nd
element,3rd element, 4th element and all the way up to the element. When I am trying to
insert the tj element, I am going to end up in comparing with all the other j elements
in the array. In that case when tj is equal to j, note that the quantity becomes its summation
of j, where j goes from 2 to n. It is of the kind and the running time n square of this
algorithm would be some constant time plus some other constant times n minus some other
constant. n(C1+C2+C3+C7)+∑nj=2 t j(C4+C5+C6)-(C2+C3+C5+C6+C7) Thus the behavior of this running time is
more like n square. We come to this point later, when we talk about asymptotic analysis
but this is what I meant by f(n square). On the other hand in the best case when tj=1,
the sum is just n or n-1 and in that case the total time is n times some constant plus
n-1 times some constant minus some constant which is roughly n times some constant. So
what we call linear time algorithm. On an average what would you expect? In the
best case it is something like that you have to compare only against one element you have
to compare only against one element and in the worst case you have to compare about j
elements. In the average case would expect that it would take compare against half of
this element In an average case if you were to take it as you comparing again j/2 , even
when the summation of j/2 where j goes from 2 to n, what will this be? This will be roughly
by (n square/4) and it behaves like n square( and will come to these points in a minute).
This is what I mean by the best, worst and average case. I take the size of input, suppose
if I am interested in sorting n numbers and I look at all possible instances of these
n numbers. It may be infinitely many, again it is not
clear about how to do that. What is worst case?
The worst case is defined as the maximum possible time that your algorithm would take for any
instance of that size. So these are all the instances are of the same size. The best case
would be the smallest time that your algorithm takes and the average would be the average
of all infinite bars. That was for the input for 1size of size n, that would give the values,
from that we can compute worst case, best case and the average case. If I would consider
inputs of all sizes then I can create a plot for each inputs size and I could figure out
the worst case, best case and an average case. Then I would get such a monotonically increasing
plots. It is clear that as the size of the input increases, the time taken by your algorithm
will increase. It is not going to happen that your input size become larger and it takes
lesser time. Which of this is the easiest to work with?
Worst case is the one we will use the most. For the purpose of this course this is the
only measure we will be working with. Why is the worst case used often? First it provides
an upper bound and it tells you how long your algorithm is going to take in the worst case. Many algorithms occurs fairly often. Quite
often it is the case that the worst case that for many instances the time taken by the algorithm
is close to the worst case .So that average case essentially becomes as bad as the worst
case In fact for the previous example that we saw average case was like n square squared
and worst case was also n squared there were differences in the constant but it was roughly
the same.The average case might be very difficult quantity to compete because as you said average
case if you have to compute look at all possible instances and then take some kind of average
.Or you have to say like, when my input instance is drawn from a certain distribution and the
expected time my algorithm will take is typically a much harder quantity to work and to compute
with. The worst case is the measure of interest
in which we will be working with. Asymptotic analysis is the kind of thing that we have
been doing so far as n and n square and the goal of this is to analyze the running time
while getting rid of superficial details. We would like to say that an algorithm, which
has the running time of some constant times squared is the same as an algorithm which
has a running time of some other constant times ,because this constant is typically
something which would be dependent upon the hardware that your using.
3n2 = n2 In the previous exampleC1,C2, and C3 would
depend upon the computer system, the hardware, the compiler and many factors. We are not
interested to distinguish between such algorithms. Both of these algorithms, one which has the
running time of 3 n square and another with running time n square have a quadratic behavior.
When the input size doubles the running time of both of the algorithm increases four fold. That is the thing which is of interest to
us. We are interested in capturing how the running time of algorithm increases, with
the size of the input in the limit. This is the crucial point here and that is what the
symptotic analysis is all about here. In the limit how does the running time of this algorithm
increase in input size. That brings us to something that some of you
might have seen before the "big-oh" O-notation. If I have functions f(n) , g (n) and n represents
the input size. f (n) measures the time taken by that algorithm. f (n) and g (n) are non-negative
functions and also non-decreasing, because as the input size increases, the running time
taken by the algorithm would also increase. Both of these are non-decreasing functions
of n and we say that f (n) is O (g (n)), if there exist constants c and , such that f
(n)≤ c times of g (n)≥ n0 . f (n) =O(g(n)
f (n) c g(n) for n ≥ n0 What does it mean? I have drawn two functions.
The function in red is f (n) and g (n) is some other function. The function in green
is some constant times of g (n). As you can see beyond the point , c (g (n)) is always
larger than that of f (n). This is the way it continues even beyond. Then we would say
that f (n) is O (g (n) or f (n) is order (g (n)). f (n) = O (g(n)) Few examples would clarify this and we will
see those examples. The function f (n) =2n+6 and g (n) =n. If you look at these two functions
2n+6 is always larger than  n and you might be wondering why this 2n+6
is a non-linear function. That is because the scale here is an exponential scale. The
scale increases by 2 on y-axis and similarly on x-axis. The red colored line is n and the
blue line is 2n and the above next line is 4n. As you can see beyond the dotted line
f (n) is less than 4 times of n. Hence the constant c is 4 and would be this point of
crossing beyond which 4n becomes larger than 2n+6. At what point does 4n becomes larger than
2n+6. It is three. So becomes three. Then we say that f (n) which is 2n+6 is O (n).
2n+6 = O (n) Let us look at another example. The function
in red is g (n) which is n and any constant time g (n) which is as same scale as in the
previous slide. Any constant time g (n) will be just the same straight line displaced by
suitable amount. The green line will be 4 times n and it depends upon the intercept,
but you're n2 would be like the line which is blue in color. So there is no constant
c such that n2 < c (n). Can you find out a constant c so that n2 < c
(n) for n more than . We cannot find it. Any constant that you choose, I can pick a
larger n such that this is violated and so it is not the case that n2 is O (n). How does one figure out these things? This
is the very simple rule. Suppose this is my function 50 n log n, I just drop all constants
and the lower order terms. Forget the constant 50 and I get n log n. This function 50 n log
n is O (n log n). In the function 7n-3, I drop the constant and lower order terms, I
get 7n-3 as O (n). I have some complicated function like 8n2
log n+ 5n2 +n in which I just drop all lower order terms. This is the fastest growing term
because this has n2 as well as log n in it. I just drop n2 , n term and also I drop my
constant and get n2 log n. This function is O ( log n). There is a constant c such that
this quantity this large sum here is less than c times n square log n for n larger than
sum n0. In the limit this quantity (8n2 log n+5n2 +n) will be less than some constant
times this quantity (O (n2 log n)). You can figure out what should be the value of c and
n0 , for that to happen. This is a common error. The function 50 n
log n is also O (n5). Whether it is yes or no. It is yes, because this quantity (50 n
log n) in fact is ≤ 50 times n5 always, for all n and that is just a constant so this
is O(n5). But when we use the O-notation we try and provide as strong amount as possible
instead of saying this statement is true we will rather call this as O (n log n)). We
will see more of this in subsequent slides. How are we going to use the O-notation? We
are going to express the number of primitive operations that are executed during run of
the program as a function of the input size. We are going to use O-notation for that. If
I have an algorithm which takes the number of primitive operations as O (n) and some
other algorithm for which the number of primitive operations is O (n2 ). Then clearly the first
algorithm is better than the second. Why because as the input size doubles then the running
time of the algorithm is also going to double, while the running time of O (n2 ) algorithm
will increase four fold. Similarly our algorithm which has the running
time of O (log n) is better than the one which has running time of O (n). Thus we have a
hierarchy of functions in the order of log n, n2,n3,n4, . There is a word of caution here. You might
have an algorithm whose running time is 1,000,000 n, because you may be doing some other operations.
I cannot see how you would create such an algorithm, but you might have an algorithm
of this running time. 1,000,000n is O (n), because this is ≤ some constant time n and
you might have some other algorithm with the running time of 2n2 .
Hence from what I said before, you would say that 1,000,000 n algorithm is better than
2n2 . The one with the linear running time which is O (n) running time is better than
O (n2). It is true but in the limit and the limit is achieved very late when n is really
large. For small instances this 2 might actually take less amount of time than your 1,000,000
n. You have to be careful about the constants also. We will do some examples of asymptotic analysis.
I have a pseudo code and I have an array of n numbers sitting in an array called x and
I have to output an array A, in which the element A[i] is the average of the numbers
X [0] through X[i]. One way of doing it is, I basically have a for loop in which I compute
each element of the array A. To compute A [10],what should I do? I just have to sum
up X [0] through X [10], which I am doing here.
For j ← 0 to I do A ← a + X[j]
A[i]← a/ (i+1) To compute A [10], i is taking the value 10
and I am running the index j from 0-10. I am summing up the value of X from X [0] - X
[10] in this accumulator a and then I am eventually dividing the value of this accumulator with
11, because it is from X [0] to X [10]. That gives me the number I should have in A [10].
I am going to repeat this for 11,12,13,14 and for all the elements. It is an algorithm and let us compute the
running time. This is one step. It is executed for i number of times and initially i take
a value from 0,1,2,3 and all the way up to n-1. This entire thing is done n times. This
gives you the total running time of roughly .
a ← a+ X[j] This one step is getting executed times and
this is the dominant thing. How many times the steps given below are executed?
A[i] ← a/ (j+1) a ← 0 These steps are executed for n times.
a ← a + X[j] But the step mentioned above is getting executed roughly for some constant
n2 times. Thus the running time of the algorithm is O (n2). It is a very simple problem but
you can have a better solution. What is a better solution? We will have a
variable S in which we would keep accumulating the X[i]. Initially S=0. When I compute A[i],
which I already have in S, X [0] through X [i-1] because they used that at the last step.
That is the problem here. a ← a +X[j] Every time we are computing X. First we are
computing X [0] + X [1], then we are computing X [0] + X [1] +X [2] and goes on. It is a
kind of repeating computations. Why should we do that? We will have a single variable
which will keep track of the sum of the prefixes. S at this point (s← s+x[i]), when I am in
the jth run of this loop has some of X [0] through X [i-1] and then some X[i] in it.
To compute jth element, I just need to divide this sum by i +1.
S ←S +X[i] A[i] ← S/ (i+1)
I keep this accumulator(S) around with me. When I finish the jth iteration of this loop,
I have an S, the sum X [0] through X[i]. I can reuse it for the next step. How much time does this take? In each run
of this loop I am just doing two primitive operations that makes an order n times, because
this loop is executed n times. I have been using this freely linear and quadratic, but
the slide given below just tells you the other terms I might be using. Linear is when an algorithm has an asymptotic
running time of O (n), then we call it as a linear algorithm. If it has asymptotic running
time of n2 , we called it as a quadratic and logarithmic if it is log n. It is polynomial
if it is nk for some constant k. Algorithm is called exponential if it has
running time of (a n), where a is some number more than 1. Till now I have introduced only
the big-oh notation, we also have the big-omega notation and big-theta notation. The "big-Omega"
notation provides a lower bound. The function f (n) is omega of g (n), f (n) =Ω (g(n)) If constant time g (n) is always less than
f(n), earlier that was more than f(n) but now it is less than f(n) in the limit, beyond
a certain as the picture given below illustrates. c g (n) f (n) for n
f (n) is more than c (g(n)) beyond the point . That case we will say that f (n) is omega
of g (n). f (n) =Ω (g (n)) In θ notation f (n) is θ (g (n), if there
exist constant and such that f (n) is sandwiched between C1 g (n) and C2 g (n). Beyond a certain
point, f (n) lies between 1 constant time g (n) and another constant time of g (n).
Then f (n) is θ (g (n)) where f (n) grows like g (n) in the limit. Another way of thinking
of it is, f (n) is θ (g (n)). If f (n) is O (g (n)) and it also Ω (g (n). There are
two more related asymptotic notations, one is called "Little-oh" notation and the other
is called "Little-omega" notation. They are the non-tight analogs of Big-oh and Big-omega.
It is best to understand this through the analogy of real numbers. When I say that f (n) is O (g (n)) and iam
really saying that the function f in some sense is less than or equal to g, that in
fact what use in definition or f (n) is less than c (g (n). The analogy with the real numbers
is when the number is less than or equal to another number. is for and is for =. θ (g
(n) is function and f=g are real numbers. If these are real numbers, you can talk of
equality but you cannot talk of equality for a function unless they are equal. Little-oh
corresponds to strictly less than g and Little-omega corresponds to strictly more. We are not going
to use these, infact we will use Big-oh. You should be very clear with that part. The formal definition for Little-oh is that,
for every constant c there should exist some such that f (n) is  n0 . f
(n) ≤ c (g(n)) for n ≥ n0 How it is different from Big- oh? In that case I said, there exist
c and such that this is true. Here we will say for every c there should exist an n0 . This is just one slide I had put up to show
what the differences between these functions is like. I have an algorithm whose running
times are like 400n, 20n log n, 2 ,2n2,n4 and 2n . Also I have listed out, the largest
problem size that you can solve in 1 second or 1 minute or 1 hour. The largest problem
size that you can solve is roughly 2500. Say you using some some constant, so it lets
say 2500if you had this has running time let say your this is what the problem size would
be like 4096. Why did you say that 4096 is larger than 2500, although 20n log n is the
worst running time than 400n, because of the constant. You can see the differences happening.
If it is 2n2 then the problem size is 707 and when it is the problem size is 19. See the behavior as the time increases. An
hour is 3600seconds and there is a huge increase in the size of the problem you solve, if it
is linear time algorithm. Still there is a large increase, when it is n log n algorithm
and not so large increase when it is an n2 algorithm and almost no increase when it is
2n algorithm. If you have an algorithm whose running time is something like 2n , you cannot
solve for problem of more than size 100. It will take millions of years to solve it. So that is the behavior that bothers us that
is the behavior we are interested in course that is why a asymptotic analysis is what
we we considering most of it. So any questions till this point so with that we are going

this course.`},{video_id:"FWmuxvOgh6Q",title:"Best Books for Learning Data Structures and Algorithms",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWmuxvOgh6Q",duration:841,transcript:"hey guys how's it going so today i want to share a few books with you that i think will help you get better at data structures and algorithms these books are not only useful if you're trying to learn data structures and algorithms for your school or your day-to-day work as a software engineer but also with technical interviews in mind so without further ado let's begin before you begin if you're new here i make videos on software engineering productivity technical interviews and that kind of stuff and if you're into similar things please subscribe and hit the notification bell icon so that you don't miss any new videos all right let's begin so the first book i recommend is this little guy called computer science distilled i came across this book probably a year ago and i think it's an amazing book just to get your head around all the topics that exist in computer science just by looking at the size of the book you'll probably guess that this is probably not an exhaustive list or a detailed explanation of the material but i think it's an amazing starting point that will at least get you familiar with the topics that exist in the space it briefly touches all the topics that you need to learn in order to be good at data structures and algorithms especially for your technical interviews it's also very light-hearted and has a good sense of humor so it's not very dense to read so even if you are just a beginner software engineer or you just started taking classes or you're switching from a different field this is a really nice and easy read to get started so this book is pretty interesting it covers your basics like ideas logic counting probability that you'll need as foundations before even starting algorithms it also has the introduction to your big on notation counting time and how things get slower or faster as your data size increases then it has the strategy section that will cover like iteration recursion backtracking dynamic programming again i can't stress enough that this is just an introduction to all these topics i mean some of these topics are huge like dynamic programming and they cover that in three pages like there's no way but the goal of this book isn't to make you an expert on any of this topic it's basically to help you sort of build the dictionary of topics in your head let's look at an example of what i mean right like there's a section here that talks about hash table it says the hash table is a data structure that allows finding items in constant time searching for an item takes constant amount of time whether you're searching among 10 million or just 10 items okay you get the rough idea you don't know in depth about what a hash table is but it looks like it is pretty efficient and it stores things and you can retrieve them in constant time by now if you've followed this book you've probably read the bigger notation so you kind of have a rough idea about what constant time means so that's cool similarly to the array the hash requires pre-allocating a big chunk of sequential memory to store data okay but unlike the array the items are not stored in ordered sequence the position of an item occupies is magically given by a hash function so this is what i mean this book introduces the topic to you but there are some of the harder topic like how the lookup is constant time or how the hash table gives you such performance is sort of magic right it's not going to explain you in depth how a hash table works but i think it gives a great introduction just one page so that you kind of get a very high level and basic understanding of what a hash table is and this is very similar with everything else it's like there's a section in graph we've seen graphs are the flexible data structure that use nodes and edges to store information they're widely used to represent data like social networks nodes are people edges are friendship relationships telephone networks nodes are telephones and stations edges are communications and much more that's it and then the next topic goes for searching in-depth searching in graph via depth research we keep following edges going deeper and deeper and then they illustrate that via a nice graph again to illustrate my point you get the idea but you're not going to get a full understanding final comment on this book is just the size itself it's so nice and light and compact easy to carry around then you can literally throw it in your backpack especially if you're a student and when you get your free time or break you just pull it out read it or if you're traveling probably not right now during covet but you know regular travel you can just carry it with you you know just refresh some topics you know it almost makes a very serious topic like data structures and algorithms kind of fun with little colorful diagrams and just the size of the book so highly recommend it especially for beginners so once you've graduated from that book you want to go ahead and get this book called rocking algorithms this book also follows a very similar pattern of being very lighthearted funny lots of diagrams to illustrate the point but goes in more depth compared to that book so once you've read that book and you've sort of have a vocabulary of words you've learned that there's thing called hash tables that exist you've learned that there's graphs and how they represent relationship between things and you can search through them via depth first or breadth first and you can do certain algorithms on them but you have no clue how to do them right like that book doesn't give you any algorithms like actual pseudo code or any code it's just an understanding and overview this is very similar but it goes into a little bit more detail and then the table of contents for this book is very similar you'll still get a bigger analysis you'll still get the sorting algorithms the basic data structures greedy algorithms searching dynamic programming that kind of stuff but because you can see it's thicker it's larger it does go into more depth it's like if that's level one this is gonna go level two i'm gonna focus on the same example for each of these books so you kind of get how in-depth they go so let's look at what this book has to say about hash tables in the other book you've learned that hash tables can give you constant time lookups and sort of how hash function makes that happen is magic right in this book however they talk about hash functions what is a hash function how does it store things and then there are a bunch of examples really nice and then it talks about like time complexity how a performance of hash table is not guaranteed right like if your hash function is bad or not efficient then you're not going to get a constant time lookup and then at this point you're like wait but the other book told me that it sort of magically happens right like it happens for built-in hash functions and stuff but now you want to understand what the magic behind it is this book's going to explain you that and then it also talks about collisions that's what happens when a hash function tries to insert two different values to the same spot that's when collision happens and then it sort of introduces that and then it also talks about when the hash function can resize and that's called maintaining a load factor see look those things you didn't know in that book but now you're gonna understand in this book right and again let me re reiterate that this is also a very light read it doesn't have any code it doesn't give you pseudo code it just gives you very illustrated examples and lots of graphs and diagrams to show you or to help you understand the idea even better than that book so i think it's a very natural progression to go from that book to this book and still till now you can go through these books without having much data structures and algorithms experience you don't need that much so even if you are like in school and you just started taking like the basic classes and you wanted to go a step ahead and kind of like get started early these are great books to get started or if you're into like mechanical engineering or different sort of engineering you want to get to coding or you you're thinking about prepping for a big fan company interview like top tech company interview and you don't know what sort of topic you need to cover these two books will sort of give you an idea and you can gauge your understanding you know these may come very naturally to some people and these books do help in that they don't talk about it in the technical jargon that most books do and it's very natural and they give real life examples so it's kind of help you grasp the topic so i think these are this is a great second book to have and then once you've figured that out maybe you've done your own research you've gone online you've looked at it in a little bit of depth and you kind of wrote some code you're you're in school and now you've taken the data structures and algorithms class that's when you bring in the big boy and this is this is a big one and it's it's almost like the bible of algorithms book it's called introduction to algorithms this as everything again those two books have same topic but in this book you will see much more technical detail it will cover everything you left pseudo code you love your mathematical analyses and everything you really need so let's look at the same thing on this guy all right in this case now we're talking about time complexities to begin with even in the first paragraph itself it starts talking about collisions but then it talks about how do you solve collisions and there's a technique called chaining it talks about that it'll give you much everything is in mathematical notation here and there are theorems and proofs and how you can get amortized constant time or you know like uh upper bound and a lower bound to your time complexity is very mathematical at this level if you're understanding algorithms and if you've gotten this far you're you're good to go you know same with graphs representations of a graph we can choose between two standard ways to represent a graph where graph is a set of vertices and edges as a collection of adjacency list as an n or an adjacency matrix either way applies to both directed and undirected graph because the adjacency list representation provides a compact way to represent sparse graph those where the edges are much lesser than the vertices and usually that's the method of choice as you can see it didn't may take any effort to explain like how oh graphs are like social networks and telephone communications that kind of stuff it's going directly to the mathematical and very uh technical uh lingo here but if you have graduated from those two books i think this is the book that you eventually want to get to because this will give you like the real implementation details and thorough understanding of algorithms but i do want to add a note here that you don't really need to know everything in this book like some of it is super mathematical you don't get carried away by this and that's also the reason that i did not recommend this book as number one because if you've never really done data structures and algorithms you're just starting and you take a look at things in this book you will you'll quit computer science i'll i'll promise you that but trust me once you once you go through the other two books and you have a good understanding of what algorithms are and what sort of things they do maybe like brush up on some math like both those book covers like some discrete math and probability counting that kind of stuff you'll find this uh much more approachable and then the final book i had for you is this is this ties very directly to technical interviews not just like learning as a software engineer it's called elements of programming interviews um this is a great book mine is an older edition i think it's like eight or ten years old so it's in c plus plus and you can get this um in java and python these days so i'll link both of those in the description below but this is a very technical interview question first approach compared to the other two books so this is a great one to either use side by side as you're learning topics or maybe go through all of them and once you feel comfortable start kind of looking into this and the chapters here are organized in a very similar approach because like like i said like the topics are same right like so you'll talk about hash table it's gonna give you a brief introduction of what a hash table is but after that it's just gonna go to a problem right like for example design a hash function for a chess game to maintain the states your function should take the state and the hash code for the state and the move and efficiently compute the hash code for the updated state so this is like a real practical implementation of hash code or a usage of ash code right away right so the other question is let s be an array of strings write a function that finds the closest pair of equal entries so not only are you learning the data structures but this will actually give you real life examples on how you can use that data structure or an algorithm to solve interview type questions i know a lot of you guys also have lead codes so maybe lead code and this is unnecessary but if you think of it lead code is like 160 a year so that's more than 10 bucks a month you know but this is going to be a like 30 40 bucks and honestly like if you can solve almost all questions on this book you don't need anything else like this not only gives you thorough explanations of how this works but it's written from engineering leaders from all of the big companies you know so i highly recommend this book so those are the three uh four books that i recommend for getting better at data structures and algorithms one final note that i wanted to add is i do suggest that you at least have an understanding of basic constructs of programming and very elementary data structures like what is an array what is a string what are primitive types what is an int what is a float how do you you know initialize variables or how do you write an if else condition how do you write a for loop while loop that's it that's that if you know that much then you'll start understanding what these are but if you if not maybe the first two books are still approachable but after that um you you'll get in trouble but um and for those um there are many free resources online that you can learn or if you're in school they're already probably teaching you but i will share a couple of other courses that are from uh really good universities and they're free on youtube so you can kind of watch those videos together with these readings and that should help you out a lot that's it if you have any questions write them in the comment below i'll try to respond to each of them if you have a question that pertains specifically to you then reach out to me on instagram and dm me and i try to respond to those too so until next time see ya bye [Music]"},{video_id:"DFpWCl_49i0",title:"INTRODUCTION TO DATA STRUCTURES",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFpWCl_49i0",duration:509,transcript:"[Music] hi friends so from today i am planning to upload the videos on data structures so in today's session we will see the introduction of a data structures that means what is a data structure and what are the different concepts covered in the this data structures right right so data structures what is meant by a data structure so the name itself indicates data structure so that means organizing the data in the memory is called a data structure so there are different ways to organize the data in the structure so one example we have seen in the c language that is errors so error is also a collection of elements that means a collection of memory locations so because in the memory locations we are going to store the values right so in that the structure of data is a sequential that means one after another right so it it occupies the contiguous memory locations so it is a collection of elements in that contiguous memory locations so that way the data is organized using the arrays data structure so finally the definition of data structure means organizing the data in the memory location so how many ways we can organize the data in the memory location right now let us see how many types of data structures so there are two types of data structures so what is primitive data structure and another one is non-primitive data structure primitive data structures and non-primitive data structures coming to this primitive data structures we have already seen those data structures see so these primitive data structures are our primitive data types yes so int float character double and pointer so all these comes under primitive data structure non-primitive data structure now so these these we have studied in c language this we call them as primitive data types right integer float character double and pointer it's a single memory location which can hold the value only next coming to this non-primitive it's again divided into two types that is linear data structures and non-linear data structures linear and non-linear so linear means a sequential that is nothing but a sequential so nonlinear which is not a sequential that we can call it as a random random right so this is a sequential this is random that means in this all the data will be arranged in sequential manner here the data is arranged in random manner now what are the types of linear data structure so first one is arrays lists stacks queues these four comes under linear data structure non-linear data structures only two categories are there one is a trees and graphs trees and graphs so again so this we have seen in c language arrays the sequential elements right so now we have to see about the list stack queue trees and graphs so how the data is arranged in list how the data is arranged in stack how the data is organized and used how the data is organized and traced and similarly graphs so these are the different types of data structures right so in the list there are a number of categories so under this one is single linked list double linked list circular linked list allow means lingualist right so here in trees we are going to discuss about binary trees binary search trees and there are a number of trees right so we will discuss in those sessions right so finally the data structure introduction is the same so primitive and non-primitive right and now there are common operations can be performed on these data structures operations so the major operations which can be done is searching and sorting so we can search an element in the data structure right so in the in the list we can uh sort the elements and then see we can insert the new element right insertion similarly deletion we can delete one element next updation so we can update the elements so that means we can replace one element with another element right so these are the common operations to be performed in these data structures so we can search an element in linked list we can sort the elements of a linked list we can insert an element into the linkedin list we can delete the element from the linked list and we can update the element in the linked list so these are the common operations so i will write here common operations on data structures so this is the common operations on data structures right so we are going to discuss about the list in the list we have to apply all these operations and then we have to see the stacks and we have to apply all these operations we have to cover the queues and all these operations similarly trees and graphs right so hope you you got an idea about these data structures and definitely i am going to upload the videos on all these concepts right right so let us stop here so from the next session we will start with the errors so our errors are already seen in our c sections so we will see the advantage and disadvantages of arrays right and then we will move on to the list in the list we have to see all these three so in the coming sessions we will cover all these concepts right so hope you got an idea about this introduction of data structures and if you really understood my sessions like my sessions share my sessions with your friends and don't forget to subscribe to our channel and please share my sessions with your friends and let them do subscribe to our channel"},{video_id:"iZmDcfTtcNg",title:"What are Data Structures?",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZmDcfTtcNg",duration:427,transcript:"what are data structures the reason we are talking about this is because if you look at the internet everyone says if you want to get into this company or that company they will ask you a question Based on data structures and algorithms so first of all why such a hype and what exactly data structures are so before we get into data structures let's talk about data see the entire software industry is based on data when you do a course on ID which we call information technology it's not about technology it's about information because we work with information so data is everything so it doesn't matter what technology you learn you basically learn or you work on it so that you can work with data example think about programming languages why do we use programming languages to process the data why do we use database to store the data why do we use AI to generate data or to understand data right I mean just to bring it down everything is data now then question arise what is data structures now if you talk about any programming language we have something called primitive data types if you want to store a number we store that in integer if you want to store a a text you store that in a string if you want to store a character you store that in a character of course depend upon different languages the term or the way you store it changes but ultimately you have some types to it where you store the data but what if you have bunch of data and if you want to store them it's not just about storing data anyone can do that it's about how do you store data efficiently and you can also save some memory the thing is if you simply dump the data you are expanding the memory and if you want to search something from the data will be difficult and that's why storing that data efficiently is very important and that's where data structures comes into picture so data structure is a way to organize and store data efficiently okay so when you say efficiently it means two things first in in terms of performance and also in terms of the memory now what about performance now think about this if you if you talk about any software application which we use it can be a normal calculator or it can be an application like Amazon website or any application which we use a banking application as well now what we do in that application is we use some features using which you can compute something you can process something example on calculator you calculate on the banking website you transfer money so what you're doing is you are basically building an application which will do some processing and the way you build an application is through algorithms now what algorithms set of instructions let's say if I want to add two numbers it's very simple you what you do is you say take two values from the user then perform the operation and give the value back to the user now those are the steps right those are the instructions now what I have mentioned the instructions those are called pseudocode because we're not actually typing a code here we're not being specific to a language let's say C C plus plus Java python JavaScript what we are simply saying is these are the steps you have to follow and that's your algorithm right but yes when you want to make it work you have to convert that into a code which was run on the computer right that's your actual software code and you can use any language as a matter right but the pseudo code will remain same now when it comes to processing of data for any task it's important for us to make it fast and also save memory now most of the companies are focusing on this concept of data structures is because they want to give a good experience to the user of course right if I'm using some application I want it to be fast now you will say okay to make the system faster you can increase the CPU speed you can increase the amount of ram you can do that but what if with the same amount of memory same amount of CPU power you can still make it more faster right and that can be done with the help of data structures now if you know how do you store that data efficiently in a proper structure and by doing that you can make your application faster because in data structures we have different type of data structures example let's say if you have bunch of data you can store that in an array but apart from Adder we have other types as well we have set we have linked list so when to use what it's not that this is best or that is best it's it's all about when to use what and to understand when to use what you have to first understand what those things are right how do you decide that this time you have to use added this time you have to use set and that's where understanding these concepts are very important now these are not the only options we have we have tree we have graph when to use them so when you understand those Concepts then we can think about okay for this situation we will use this and this is why companies are preferring candidates who knows DSA it will help them in multiple ways first it helps them to reduce the cost is because every computation see uh I know you may be thinking most of the applications which we use are free right think about Instagram now when we use Instagram of course we are not paying for it but then companies are paying for it right so the meta is paying for for you to use Instagram so because those computations will be happening somewhere maybe meta is using some cloud service let's say Amazon is in this case So Meta is basically paying to Amazon for every computation which you do okay of course they earn from ads but then they are paying for it so what they will do is they will try to optimize it they will say okay if one query takes let's say one dollar or maybe half a dollar can we just reduce it more can we just make it 10 cents so that's the thing they are trying to do and the way you can do that is by making sure you use a proper algorithm with a proper data structure so why companies are doing it to reduce the cost second to give a better customer experience so that it will run faster and if I search something it should be faster for me as well so as a customer next when companies want to hire people they have so many candidates right how will they filter those candidates now data structures algorithm becomes one of the way to filter the candidates because if you know data structures that means you have worked a lot on the particular language and you understand how how a particular system works on the other hand data structures are not the only thing you need to know if you want to be a good developer if you want to get hired there are multiple things needed example you need to have a good hold on a particular language a particular technology you should have worked on few projects understanding the entire ecosystem not just one language working with databases working with networking but then DSA becomes one of the important thing there so just to summarize what are data structures so data structures is basically a way to organize and store your data in the efficient way and there are multiple data structures options available there and you will understand that in the upcoming sessions we're going to talk about in the upcoming videos you will we will talk about what are the types of data structures we have how to use them when to use what and what algorithms available there so I hope you got some idea regarding data structures so of course entire series is important to understand that properly so I hope you're excited see you in the next video"},{video_id:"ouipSd_5ivQ",title:"10 Key Data Structures We Use Every Day",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouipSd_5ivQ",duration:523,transcript:"[Music] in this video we discuss a topic That's essential to every software developer data structures we use them every day and they play a critical role in building efficient systems so let's Dive Right In and take a closer look at some common examples let's start by discussing lists lists are a versatile and essential data structure in software development they are great for storing and manipulating order data they are useful in various applications like task management social media feeds and shopping carts in a task management application a list can be used to store and organized tasks for each user task can be added removed or reordered easily and user can mark them as complete as needed lists are also useful in social media applications like Twitter where they can store and display a users feed in real time ensuring the latest content is shown in the correct order arrays are another fundamental data structure they provide a fix siiz order collection of elements they're particularly well suited for situations where the size of the collection is known or doesn't change frequently arrays are commonly used in mathematical operations storing large data sets or when there's a need for random access to elements for example in a weather application an array could be used to store temperature readings for a specific location over a defined period this allows for easy calculations like averages and trans arrays are also widely used in image processing where each pixel's color data can be represented in a two-dimensional array it enables efficient manipulation and transform of the image next we have stacks Stacks follow the last in first out principle they are perfect for supporting undo and redo operations in text editors or maintaining browsing history in web browsers in a text editor a stack can be used to store each change made to the text making it simple to revert to a previous state when the user triggers an undo operation qes operate on a first in first out basis they are good for managing printer jobs sending user actions in games or handling messages in chat applications in chat applications a q can be used to store incoming messages in the order they are received it ensures that they are displayed to the recipient in the correct sequence heaps on the other hand are used for task scheduling and memory management they're especially helpful in implementing priority cues where we need to access the highest or lowest priority item efficiently trees organize data hierarchically they are useful for representing data with natural hierarchies or relationships they can be used in various applications like database indexing AI decision making or file systems in AI decision making trees like decision trees are used in machine learning for classification tasks trees are also used in database indexing where they can help speed up search insert or delete operations for example B trees and B+ trees are commonly used in relational databases to efficiently manage and index large amounts of data hash tables for efficient data lookup insertion and deletion they use a hash function to map keys to their corresponding storage locations it enables constant time access to the store values hash tables are widely used in various applications such as search engines caching systems and programming language interpreters or compilers in search engines hash tables can be used to store and quickly retrieve index data based on keywords this provides fast and relevant search results caching systems may use hash tables to store and manage cache data it allows for Rapid access to frequently requested resources and improves overall system performance another example is the implementation of symbol tables in programming language interpretors or compilers hash tables can be used to efficiently manage and look up variables functions and other symbols defined in the source code suffix trees are specialized for searching strings in documents this makes them perfect for text editors and search algorithms in a search engine a suffix tree can be used to efficiently locate all occurrences of a search term within a large Corpus of text graphs are all about tracking relationships and finding paths this makes them invaluable in social networks recommendation engines and path finding algorithms in a social network a graph can be used to represent the connections between users it enables features like friend suggestions or analyzing Network Trends R trees are good at finding nearest neighbors they are crucial for mapping apps and geolocation services in a mapping application all trees can be used to store spatial data such as points of interest this enables efficient queries to find the nearest locations based on the users's current positions now let's discuss cach friendless and how it relates to various data structures including lists arrays and other mentioned earlier in the video CPU cach is a small fast memory between the main memory and the CPU it stores recently accessed data and instructions so the CPU can access them quickly without fetching them from the slower main memory now different data structures have varying levels of cach friendliness based on how their elements are store in memory contiguous memory storage like that in arrays allow for better cach locality and fewer cach misses resulting in improved performance when an array element is accessed the Cache can prefetch and store nearby elements anticipating that they might be accessed soon on the other hand data structures with non-contiguous memory storage like link list can experience more cach misses and reduce performance in the link list elements that story in notes scatter throughout the memory and each note contains a pointer to the next note in the sequence this makes it difficult for the CPU to predict and load the next Noe before it's needed the other data structures such as trees hash tables and graphs also have varying degrees of cash friendliness based on the implementation and use case now this disparity in Access times can lead to Performance issues in modern Computing particularly in situations where cash misses occur frequently we should be mindful of this when working with performance critical application and choose the appropriate data structure based on the specific requirements and constraints of the projects and there you have it these are just some of the many data structures we use every day as software developers understanding and mastering these data structures will help us build more efficient systems making us better at our craft if you like our videos you may like our system design

in 15 Minutes",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oz9cEqFynHU",duration:979,transcript:"being good at data structures and algorithms is a computer science equivalent of having i mean everyone assumes you're a genius you get high paying offers from prestigious companies and you even have a high social market value on internet forums but the journey from lead cell to algo chat is not an easy one it's filled with frustration and imposter syndrome i know i've been there but now i have offers from feng which basically qualifies me to cure cancer so to give back and help even the most confusing programmers consider this video my cure since this industry is cancer [Music] the most important part of learning something new is that you actually want to learn it this is why i failed out of spanish one so before we start ask yourself why do you want to learn this don't do it to get a job at google do it because learning this changes the way you think data structures and algorithms is about solving problems efficiently a bad programmer solves the problem inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn't even know why their solution is inefficient so let's start with that how do we rank an algorithm's efficiency [Music] say we wrote a function that goes through every number in a list and adds it to a total sum variable if you consider adding to be one operation then running this function on a list with 10 numbers costs 10 operations running it on a list with 20 numbers costs 20 operations say we wrote another function that just returns the first number in a list then no matter how large the list is this function will never cost more than one operation clearly these two algorithms have a different time complexity or relationship between growth of input size and growth of operations we communicate these time complexities using big o notation referring to input size as n common complexities are constant linear quadratic logarithmic n log n exponential and factorial our first algorithm runs in o of n meaning its operations grow in a linear relationship with the input size which in this case is the amount of numbers in the list our second algorithm is not dependent on the input size at all so it runs in constant time let's take a look at how many operations a program will have to execute in a function with an input size of 5 versus 50. it might not matter when the input is small but this gap gets very dramatic as the input size increases if n were 10 000 a function that runs in log of n would only take 14 operations while the function that runs in n factorial would set your computer on fire for big o notation we drop constants so o of 10 times n and o of n over 10 are both equivalent to o of n because the graph is still linear and bagel notation is also used for space complexity which works the same way for how much space an algorithm uses as n grows unless you sit in your room doing algorithms all day there's a good chance you forgot what logarithms are logarithms are the inverse to exponential functions let's say i wanted to find a word in a dictionary one method is to check every word one by one this is o n but nobody does that so how are humans able to find any word in a dictionary with a hundred thousand words in seconds we do something more along method two cut the search window in half each time by checking the middle element if we passed our word search on the left half otherwise search on the right half and then we repeat this until we find our word if our input n doubled in size that would only grow our operations by one in computer science this is the binary search but for the binary search to work the collection has to be sorted which opens up a huge field of computer science sorting algorithms a very basic sort is a selection sort you have one pointer at the start of the list and another pointer that is linear scan to find the next minimum element then you swap those elements and increment the pointer since you're doing a linear scan for every element in the collection this runs in all of n squared a more efficient algorithm is the merge sort a merged source splits a collection in half into sub-collections until those sub-collections can be sorted in constant time and then it works its way back up by merging sorted subcollections until the entire collection is sorted since it's splitting in half there will be log n splits and thereby log n merges it is o then to merge two sorted collections into one sorted collection since we're doing that log n times the time complexity is of n times log n no algorithm can sort an arbitrary collection in a better time complexity than that so we consider n log n to be the cost of sorting perhaps the most fundamental data structure is an array an array is an indexable contiguous chunk of memory arrays are fixed size you can't insert a ninth element into an array meant for eight elements a list data structure with a flexible size is a linked list the idea is to package your data into nodes that hold one your data and two a point that points to the next node traversing a linked list reminds me of those youtube direction chains like you see a comment that says read my profile picture and their profile picture says click on my profile which brings you to their header which says read my bio so you go to their bio and it says click the link below and you click it and then it installs a virus onto your browser if a note's next pointer points to null it's the end of the list you can add a new node to the list in constant time by just setting that pointer to the new node by doing additional tom [ __ ] with pointers we can also insert and delete nodes in constant time sometimes nodes also contain a pointer to the previous node in a variation called the doubly linked list but a major downside of linked list is that you can't access elements in constant time via index like an array in practice both programming languages have dynamically sized arrays or lists which work by creating arrays with a fixed size if the array is full capacity and you try to add a new element the programming language automatically creates a new array with double the capacity copies the current elements over and sets your pointer to that new array since this happens so infrequently we generally consider appending to a list to be a constant time operation link lists aren't the only data structure that include nodes referring to other nodes what if instead of pointing to a next node nodes pointed to a left and a right child node this is called a binary tree these child notes can also be called subtrees since trees are recursive in nature a node with no children is called a leaf node while a node with seven children is my father-in-law a common type of tree is the binary search tree which follows these rules basically a node's left child must have a smaller value while a node's right child must have a greater or equal value let's say you're looking for element x you start at the root and if the number is smaller than the root you go to the left tree if it's larger you go to the right and you keep repeating this until you arrive at your number in the worst case you have to traverse the height of the tree so the time complexity to search insert and delete elements is of h where h is the height this is efficient because on average the height will be log n but what if you inserted every element of a sorted array into an empty binary search tree well that's a linked list meaning the height would be n but we can guarantee log n time complexities using a self-balancing binary search tree such as red black trees which maintain additional properties to guarantee that the height of the tree is o of log n binary search trees are kind of considered to be a workhorse distribution that can solve most problems with decent efficiency but i found situations where binary search trees really shine are when you're asked a question about binary search trees another type of tree is a heap the primary difference between this and the binary search tree is actually use this one it's also sometimes called a priority queue because at the root of it is always the highest priority element and min heap will have the min element and the max heap will have the max element at the root but don't get me wrong the rest of the heap is unsorted it is an absolute wasteland down there searching in the rest of the heap may as well be an unsorted array we only care about what's at the top just like capitalism to insert a new element into a heap first we find the next available spot to add a leaf node then we compare it with his parents and if it's a higher priority it swaps and bubbles his way up we're doing at most log n comparisons you can build a heap from a random collection by inserting n times which cost o of n log n but there's also a way to build a heap in o of end time i'd suggest reading this wikipedia page because it's super interesting stuff and lastly since the heap is nearly complete although we can visualize it as a tree we could actually use these properties to represent it with an array one way to traverse a tree is a depth first search which is like going deep fully exploring one path and then moving on to the next one way to visit this tree in a depth first order could be to start at 10 go to 13 go to 4 then 6 then 12 then 8 and then 1 whereas another option is a breadth first search where we view it more level by level a way to print this same tree in a bfs manner could be 10 13 12 4 6 8 1. when it comes to implementation depth first search can use a stack a stack is a list-based data structure where the only two operations are add to the end and pop from the end this makes a stack lifo last in first out dfs are often done using recursion which indirectly uses a stack the recursive stack so if your recursion exceeds a certain amount of depth then you get a stack overflow let's look at a way to print this tree in a dfs matter using a stack so first initialize the stack and add the root then while there are still elements in the stack pop from the stack print that element and then add its children to the stack on the contrary a breadth first search uses a queue a queue is fifo first in first out so instead of popping from the end of the list you pop from the beginning doing the same algorithm as before but using a q instead of a stack the tree will now print in a bfs order all trees are graphs but not all graphs are trees a graph is a collection of vertices which are like points and edges which are like connections from one vertex to another vertex a graph can be directed meaning edges can only go one way so this edge means you can only go from a to b or undirected meaning you can also go from b to a two common ways to model edges are adjacency lists and adjacency matrices graphs are my favorite part of destruction algorithms so i'd like to show how cool they are with three example scenarios on where you can use them so it recently dawned on me that i know kanye west and by that i mean i know joma tech but joma tech knows jarvis johnson who knows mkbhd who knows elon musk who knows kanye west which is five degrees of separation between me and kanye west i wanted to find something shorter well turns out i know bretman rock who knows rihanna who knows kanye three degrees of separation which also means that anyone who knows me is at most four degrees of separation away from kanye if we wanted to make a program that computes the smallest degrees of separation between two people a graph would be the perfect choice you model people as vertices and you model relationships as edges the shortest path between the source node me and the target node kanye can be found with a breath first search since we're moving out level by level we can guarantee that the first time reaching the kanye node will also be the shortest path the problem with implementing this algorithm the way i just described is that nobody has a concrete list of all the people they know nor would that be publicly accessible by me but a possible variation could be in a social network like facebook where we can use the friend list as edges we would then be able to run this algorithm and find the smallest degrees of separation between any two users in that social network imagine a map system like google maps that wants to find the shortest path between two locations this is different than the last example because although they both deal with shortest paths the degrees of separations did not have weighted edges where a map system does for example if we're computing the shortest path between two vertices and there's a direct edge between them weighing 20 versus a path of two edges weighing eight each a breath first search would give us the shortest path in terms of the vertices away but not the smallest weight one algorithm that computes the shortest path in a graph with positive weighted edges is dijkstra's algorithm using the heap data structure in the original version of this video i explained dijkstra's and my video shot up 6 minutes so instead just research it for yourself if you're interested but graphs aren't just good for path finding imagine a course schedule in school with classes and prerequisites for each class and say you wanted to find the order in which you can take all your classes while still fulfilling your prerequisites well model the classes as vertices and prerequisites as edges count how many incoming edge each vertex has add vertices with zero incoming edges to a queue then pop and print the element from the queue and decrement the incoming edges of all its children if a child now has zero incoming edges add it to the cube and repeat while there are still elements in the queue this algorithm is known as a topological sort [Music] hash maps are sort of the holy grail of data structures with basically constant time retrieval of data the saying goes that if you don't know what you're doing just try throwing hashtags at the question as an example one time i was in a coding interview and froze so i just told the interviewer hmm i think the solution to use a hash map unfortunately the question was what are your biggest weaknesses so the better answer was hang up the phone to show that i have none a hashmap is a data structure built on top of an array optimized to store key value pairs what makes it so powerful is you can retrieve delete and store data in on average constant time here we have a map where keys are strings representing people's names and values are their corresponding ages we can directly access trend black's age like this it's almost as if strings can be used as indices but how is that even possible because of this little thing called a hash function a hash function will take a key and return a hash code if we take that number modulus the length of its underlying array we can use that as an index to store its value but the hash function has to compute the same hash code if given the same key so hash of trend black should always return the same hash code or else we lose the index but what if hash of trend black and hash of ziz both end with the same index well this is called collision one way to deal with this is to store our value in a linked list so when we go to stores is and see that index three already has a value we have that value point to the new value this is why a hash map is not strictly of one because if you write some god awful hash function then it won't be balanced and we will have to do a lot of linkless traversing good hash functions evenly spread out hash codes in practice modern languages use very good hash functions so you don't have to write your own an example of a hashmap is the dictionary in python or the object in javascript and remember constant lookup of data is very overpowered so try to use it when you can [Music] and that's pretty much all you need to know for data structures and algorithms a six month college course taught in 13 minutes now of course you didn't learn anything in great detail but trust me it is a lot easier to learn something in great detail if you already learned the big picture first this is why college sucks at teaching it dives very deep into one topic and then moves on to the next it's like a depth first search i believe the better way of learning is to get a general understanding and then build on it like a breath first search so if you want to keep going what are my recommendations to build on your knowledge well the first one is jomo class you know those really nice animations in this video like this one yeah i got them from joma class if you don't care about getting extremely theoretical and just want simple to the point everything you need to know and nothing you don't type lessons then jomo class makes this difficult topic very accessible but i will admit that i roasted the [ __ ] out of jomah a while back because he was pushing some actual snake oil well unlike some people he took my criticism very well and to vindicate his name he made something that is actually valuable and i will defend that he put much more effort into these explanations dropped the price from a thousand dollars to eight dollars a month and most importantly he dropped the dead weight if you're a complete beginner it also comes with a course on how to code in python and of course on sql if you're a bit more advanced but i gotta say the best part is the community aspect each lesson has a whole community behind it where people ask questions discuss topics and just learn together well i like the course so much that i actually called joma and i was like yo what the [ __ ] dude this is actually good i'm gonna start recommending this to people and he was so excited to hear that i liked it that he was actually willing to offer my audience a discount so if you go to trend.jomoclass.com then you'll get 15 off but even though paying for stuff increases the chance that you'll actually complete it you don't have to spend money not everyone has eight dollars a month to drop and i want to assure you that you can still learn everything for free so it might take a bit more self-discipline but you can do it so don't listen to anyone who says you have to pay so if you do want to go down the free route i'd recommend these college lectures they're literally taught by mit professors and posted for free online they're pretty theoretical but very comprehensive and it's perfect if you like that old-school chalkboard setting so yeah good luck guys and go get that guck 3000"},{video_id:"wy0TPi9M7VM",title:"Abstract Data Types | DSA",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy0TPi9M7VM",duration:440,transcript:"welcome back aliens my name is David ready and in this video we'll talk about ADT which is abstract data type now before we move towards ADT let's talk about data here of course in the previous video when we talked about what are data structures we have talked about data and we also mentioned that in the software industry everything is about data so whatever you do you are doing it for data right now with this data basically you get data from the user you process data you also give the output to the user or maybe you want to store this data in the database for the permanent storage but the thing is it's all about data and whenever we use any language doesn't matter which language you use what you do is you store that data in your code somewhere and to store that data we use something called a variable now imagine variable as a box and you are keeping your data inside that box the problem is every box need to have a type of course there are languages which are dynamically typed language where you don't don't actually mention the type of the variable but in general this box will have a type so that means if you want to store the data you need a box which is your variable and this variable also needs a type to it or this box needs a type to it now example let's say if you want to store a number so we can use something called an integer or if you have any other point values you can also use float or double now it depends about the languages how they work but in most of the languages we have something in common we have integer for the normal numbers we have a float for the point values and what if you want to store a text that's why we have string and in few languages we don't have all these types we have limited types and in other languages we have many but that doesn't matter right in general we'll be having a variable and a type to it now all this type are called data types and they are system defined data types or you can also call them as primitive types is because it's there in the language itself you can directly use them but sometimes you want to use some complex data type and we can create that with the help of some other Concepts example let's say if you want to represent a human or if you want to represent a phone now I love phone so I'm I'll be using that example so if we talk about this phone here now this phone will have a name to it right so it will have a name it will have a brand of course name is model number then brand then the configuration the amount of CPU Ram all this are your data right so if you want to represent any physical thing in the virtual world we use objects there right now in some languages which are object-oriented programming we do that with help of objects example in C we use something called structures so we can define a structure name let's say phone and inside that you can specify what are the properties there in the same way in the object limited languages we use something called class in this class you create different variables with primitive type and then the Box itself or the class itself is your complex data type or you can say user defined data type user defined because system is not giving you we are defining our own type right so that's about data and data types but let's say if you want to store a bunch of data how will you work with that and when it comes to data structure how will you store this data in a proper way see what happens is when you talk about primitive types as well every type will have a way to store data of course that's why we are getting them right so example if you are creating a variable called num now let's say this num is of type integer and then you are storing a value to it now with this variable num you can perform operations as well now what are the options you can do with integer you can add two values you can subtract two values you can divide multiply so you can perform those operations on the number but let's say you have a string there now which string of course you will not be adding two strings that doesn't make sense right why you will add two names let's say then you will get a new name okay a lot of parents are doing that for their kids but that's not the idea here right we can't add a string we cannot subtract strings but yes which string you can do something else maybe you want to see the size of a string maybe you want to concatenate two strings maybe you want to cut two strings so string has a different operations in the same way if you are creating your own type this will have data of course but also you have to you have to mention the operations which are going to perform so we have two things right we have data and we have operations now let's say in data structures you want to store a bunch of data as we mentioned and you want to store it so there's a concept of array so if you have multiple data instead of showing them in multiple variables let's say you have five numbers uh 2 6 12 21 and so on now if you have all these values you basically store that in five different variables or you can create a single array and you can store all the values there the advantage would be you have just have to use one variable name there so instead of saying a b c d e you can simply say nums you can use any variable just doesn't matter so what's important is you can use array here now when we use array we are not basically using a primitive type here we are creating our own type here own data type which is an array now in this array basically you should be also able to perform some operation example let's say what if you want to read some value you want to fetch a particular element you want to search the array maybe you want to add an element maybe you want to delete an element so this operation should be possible on that type so in the concept way when you have a type where you can perform some operation we call them as abstract is because the implementation for array changes from language to language and we don't just have added right so let's say if you want to store a bunch of values we can use list we can use set queue now when you talk about a queue here let's say now inside Q we have I mean we have one more option for that which is stack they follow different concepts so let's say if you want to add element in the queue which follows last in first out which means you have to insert from the end and you will get it from the first of course you can reverse it you can insert from the start and you can take it from the end the thing is you have you will insert from one end and you will remove from the other end so that is first in first out in stack it is reverse you do last in first out example let's say uh took an example let's say for Q we can say a queue which you follow right example if you want to buy a coffee from a cafe shop of course there's a cue there you have to stand in a queue and then when your number comes you will get the coffee so basically the first person who went there first will be getting the coffee first right in terms of Stack it is different so when you keep multiple books the first book which you can take out is the last book which you have kept there right it is the last in first out that is your stack now we have different way of implementing in different languages the concept remains same right so when you have a concept and the associated operations to it and of course with data which we call them as abstract data type we also have map but we'll talk about those things later at this point the point remember is we can create our own types and which is a concept and if you want to have data inside that and also you want to specify what operations you can perform that is your abstract data type of course in this subscription videos I will talk about how do you create them how do you work with them and it will be fun so see you in the upcoming videos Everyone bye"},{video_id:"n0e27Cpc88E",title:"What is Abstract Data Types(ADT) in Data Structures ? | with Example",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0e27Cpc88E",duration:616,transcript:"yo what's going on guys Thun Meyer for simple snippets and welcome back to another video tutorial under data structures and algorithms and in this video tutorial we're going to be understanding what is an abstract data type in data structures so when you're studying data structures you'll come across this term abstract data types quite often and it's a theoretical concept so we will quickly understand this and the best way to understand this is by taking examples so in this video tutorial we'll understand what exactly is an abstract or logical view and the implementation view of a data structure so that is the two ways in which we can study or view at data structures and we'll understand this by taking an example so with that being said let's get started so what exactly is a abstract data type now we have the definition of data structures which we've already seen in the previous video but I just mentioned it so that you can reiterate it so in computer science of data structure is a way of data organization management and storage that enables efficient access and modification so this is something that we've cleared out in the previous video of this data structures playlist but the way we look at data structures can be categorized into two parts you know or two different types the one is where we actually have a logical or abstract or mathematical view or model wherein we just specify what all things the data structure is going to have now we know that data structure is a way of storing data right so when I'm seeing way it means that there are some protocols there are some rules that are gonna be followed right so all those protocols all those rules can be modeled as a proper view or a model and you can basically just write down all the specifications right so that comes under the logical or abstract or mathematical model or view on the second way or the second part you can say is the implementation part wherein you use all those rules and regulations and actually implement that using some programming language right so Indian obviously we are going to be implementing these data structures in practicals by using some programming language in our case we are going to be using C++ programming right so all these programming syntaxes will be based on this mathematical and logical or abstract model so now that you have a overview of the ways in which you can look at data structures let's try to define what the abstract data type is and let's take those samples into consideration okay so when you are talking about abstract data types ADT is that is the short form are entities there are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details so basically the abstract data type is the logical or mathematical or abstract view that we were talking about right so here we have the entities that are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation which means that we know what we are going to be storing and we also know the operations that can be performed and the way in which the data is going to be stored depending upon what data structure we are going through but we haven't yet implemented it in any practical sense now the reason why we do not have any implementation in edit is because every different programming language has different implementations for example a particular data structure in C can be implemented using the concept of structures but that same data structure can be implemented by using the concept of objects and classes in Java programming and so on and so forth you know so different programming languages have different implementation strategies to tackle different abstract data types so basically data structures are these abstract data types which has specifications about how the data is going to be stored and what are the operations that can be performed on these data types and these different entities but the implementation depends upon the programming language that we use okay so to get this thing more cleared out let's actually take a real-world example so here's a real world example of a smart phone okay so if we were to look at this smart phone in an abstract or logical view what we are going to be doing is we're just going to be defining what all things does a smart phone have at a high level okay for example this smart phone will have 4 GB RAM this smart phone is having a Snapdragon 2.2 gigahertz processor so every smartphone has a ram as processor has a 5.5 inch LCD screen now the screen size obviously varies depending upon what smartphone we're using but this particular smartphone has dual cameras it has Android operating system which is 8.0 version and whatnot you know and along with all these properties this smartphone also has some functionality also has some operations and behaviors right so this is what that operation stands for and this is the data rate so information can be termed as a data of that particular entity we are looking at smartphone so this is all the information and data about that smartphone and the operations are you can use your smart phone to call you can use it to perform text you can send text you can click photos you can click videos and so on and so forth so these come under the behavior and the operations rate so this is what an abstract or logical view of this smartphone looks like wherein you just hitting all the different properties and all the different operations and behaviors that that particular entity can do but when you look at the implementation view over your so when you are actually implementing this in terms of programming in terms of actual code this is how the pool would look like in a proper C++ programming language so you are creating a class so of course we have objects and classes in the C++ programming language if it was C then we could have used structures so in that we have these different variables created follow those respective properties right we have RAM size processor name we have screen size and their respective data types obviously in string float and then we also have some methods which correspond to these behaviors so we avoid call text and obviously the definition can be defined later on but right now I just want to state or show you how the implementation he would look like now if this was some other programming language let's say it was Java or Python obviously syntax is going to be changing some keywords and some mechanism is also going to be changing right which means that the implementation view can change however the abstract and logical view is independent of this implementation so this is what this hashtag datatype actually means now coming to our data structures word let's take an example in the data structures environment ok so let's take the basic integer array so we've seen an array data structure in the previous video also so let's continue with that only so that you'll understand it in a better way now here's an example which has an integer array of size 4 okay so we have the index position starting from 0 1 2 3 so array is a data structure wherein it is a collection of elements which has stored add contiguous memory locations so you can see in the orange we have memory addresses which are just one besides other so one thousand one thousand four one thousand eight and one thousand twelve so this is basically in bytes and each integer element in C++ takes up four bytes so that's why four bytes and then we have 1 0 0 4 and then one 0:08 and the addresses are allocated just right besides each other which means that it is contiguous in nature and not continuous okay we have index positions allocated and then the blue ones are the actual values so this first position is storing value 10 this 20 30 and 40 so this implementation so this is basically what an array is and all these index positions value memory address all these things are implemented in programming languages differently by different programming language right so the abstract or logical view of this integer array can be stated as this data structure or this array store a set of elements of integer datatype so in this case we are using integer array right so you can also say of a particular datatype if you want to go more generic then we need elements by position that is index so we have indexes to access different positions starting from 0 we can again modify elements by its index so if we access one particular index we can change the value at that index and we can also perform sorting and obviously there would be many more things that can be done using this array data structure right now I've just given an example of how I abstract or logical we would look like now coming to the implementation side this is how it will look like in C++ programming so the syntax would be int arr I am creating an array of size Phi in this case and not for I am having one two three four five as the actual element so I am also initializing the array I am saying C out ARR of one which means I want the value at position two okay so this is zero index position this is one index position if I am saying error of one so the output would be two over here now what I am doing is I am saying error of 2 equals to 10 so this is the third position or second index value the value is 3 over here but when I am saying error of 2 equals to 10 the new value will be 10 so I am modifying it by using the index rate so this is what is specified over here so this is basically the implementation view so when we are talking about abstract data types it is just entities which have a definition for how the data is going to be stored and what kind of data is going to be showed and what are the operations that are going to be operating on that particular data so this was an example of array rate so if you go ahead and check out other data structures as we move ahead we will obviously see them but just for example we can talk about stat szostak is a linear data structure which works on last in first out which means the last value being added into the stack will be popped out first or you can also say first in last out which means the first value that goes in will be the last one to come out so that would be written in this logical view and then obviously the implementation is something that we have to type in in form of code depending upon what kind of programming language you use so that's why implementation always keeps on changing a little bit here and there obviously the operation that is the actual behavior is always going to be the same just that since every programming language has its unique properties also the implementation slightly changes okay so this was a little bit detail about what is abstract data types you don't really have to stress out on this topic it is not really a big thing it is just as I mentioned small entities that are having definitions of data in operation but do not have implementation that's about it this is one line that should be enough and as you can see we've also talked about the example so abstract data types are nothing but the specification that we provide without the implementation okay so that's it for this video guys I hope you have got an idea about what are abstract data types you might come across this term quite often as you move I'd so thanks for watching guys if you like this video please share it with your friends do give it a like let me know comments of this video watch and I'll see you guys in the next video peace"},{video_id:"bR0NYdmMg94",title:"Arrays and Abstract Data Type in Data Structure (With Notes)",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bR0NYdmMg94",duration:1525,transcript:`So guys I have a friend that wanted to build a PC So he approached me and asked "Harry, can you give me a blueprint to build a PC?" "So that with that blueprint I can make someone build a PC?" "I want to do gaming and streaming." So I told him, "Do this one thing, buy the motherboard of MSI tomahawk b450," "And along with that, buy an AMD Ryzen 3550 processor," "And with that, don't buy an expensive graphic card;" "Use 10-50 TI, okay?" So I gave him this blueprint. But why am I telling this to all of you? I'm telling this to you because This blueprint of the PC that I gave him With the help of that blueprint, He can go to any store, or by himself He can build a PC. And I told him all the main components of a PC, And even if he makes a mistake, It won't be a big deal. And he won't be able to make a mistake if he follows the blueprint correctly. Okay? So what was here was, I gave him a blueprint Okay? I gave him a blueprint And a...let's say that there were some minimal requirements. That need to be put in a PC, And now, with the help of this, he'll make his PC build. Okay? Now how is PC build related to Abstract Data Type? You might not even know what PC build is, maybe Or maybe you guys are champions, but that's not the point. The point is that I told him which processor to use, I told him which graphic card to use, I told him which motherboard to use, Maybe I'll even tell him the RAM chips; "Listen use these chips," You can use Kingston ones...there are a lot of chips in RAM; let it be. But, I gave him a blueprint, And I said, "With the help of this blueprint, build a PC." Now this Abstract Data Type is... Abstract Data Type is a type of blueprint just like this, That does what? It tells us minimal requirements along with some operations. Okay? So there here there are some operations, And along with that, there are some minimal requirements That the data type will follow. Okay? Here I'll write minimal requirements. So abstract data type is a model To make a data structure. This means that once I give in the abstract data type, Then after seeing the abstract data type, Anyone can write the implementation of this data structure. And they can make a data structure.  And this data structure will be the actual implementation. So abstract data type if I say about arrays So you can implement it in many ways in different programming languages. But I will give you some minimal requirements And some operations on them. So this abstract data type In that, I will give you MRF. Not the MRF tyres, nor the bat one; I'll give you minimal...minimal Required functionalities, okay? And if any of this confuses you a bit, Functionality; okay? This might sound a little confusing Because you guys will ask, "What is this ADT; how did it come?" Just understand the way I made this for PC, I gave the minimal required functionality. In this, you can do streaming and gaming; These are some of its functionalities. And along with this, I told you That all of these things should be there. After this, anybody can make it using any cable; They can use any RAM to make it. Many implementations can be made for this. Many PCs can be made using these components. Similarly, what is abstract data type? It tells us some minimal required functionalities, It says, "I want all of these." For example, if you go to a carpenter, And say, "I want a table. I want a table that is adjustable," "I should be able to code while standing, and I should be able to code while sitting." "The rest is your choice to make anything," "You can use iron, wood, plastic, aluminium; use anything, I'll be fine with it." "But this is the minimum required functionality that I need." And some operations, that you can define later on your own. For example, in that table...let us say You give an operation, like...to open a drawer So you'll give an open operation in it, Along with that, you close the drawer, You'll give an operation of that type. Let's understand this with the example of an array. Now we'll talk about array ADT. Let me just clear the board If you guys are taking notes, good for you; But I have made the notes, you should definitely download them from the description.  You all should definitely download the notes. Okay? I'll rub this away now And uh...I'll rub this away And along with that, what will we do? We will study array ADT. Array as an Abstract Data Type. Okay? Arrays as an abstract data type. By the way, what are arrays? Arrays can be found in a lot of programming languages. Arrays can be found in C, C++, and Java; in Python, they are called 'lists'. But, there are some minimal required functionalities in arrays. For example, you might want to be able to so Get, There is a Get method in that And if I write Get (i), then I should get the element for the i-th position I can do any Set; I can set any number at the i-th position. As in I can make the value of index 'i' numb. Okay? Along with that, Get is done, Set is done. Then if I'm making a custom data type If I'm writing an implementation of the array, In that, I can bring in some methods, For example, here I can put in a method, 'Insert', That you can perform on arrays I can put in a method in the array, 'Add' If I want to add two arrays. So there can be many methods like these, It depends on the implementation Okay? But the minimal functionality of the array That you'll be able to Get and be able to Set. Okay? And along with that here there can be a resize functionality All of these are methods, or they are operations Okay? That you can perform on arrays So you can make your custom data type By using this blueprint And it will depend on your implementation. For example, I will show you while making it using a structure But you in C++ you can make it with classes. Now if you're making it with structure, It's your choice; it will depend on your implementation, That when the size of the array is increasing, How will you resize it? If there is a resize method Or are you copying everything? Are you using some other strategy? Are you keeping an auxiliary array already? So these things depend upon the implementation Okay? So here, in the array I have defined the Get and Set; these minimum functionalities For this abstract data type. And along with that, these methods can be various methods There can be various operations that you can find in an array. Okay? Now all these operations can be defined And we can make our own array ADT. Now, what does abstract mean? Abstraction means hiding details. It's very important. What does abstraction mean? In the local language, if I have to explain abstraction, Then it means, eat the mangoes, don't count the kernels. What does abstraction mean? Abstraction means eat the mangoes, don't count the kernels. Meaning, don't go for the implementation details. Don't go for the implementation details. Only go for the usage Please use it. Implementation is hidden. All these things will be hidden We'll say that use Insert and insert it in the array It has nothing to do with you, That we've made a structure inside the insert Or we've made a pointer Or if we've cramped up anything else inside it That's my concern; you guys just use it. Like when you buy a phone, Do you open it and see it? Which screws does it have, and which processor does it have? You read the box, that it has a certain processor But it's not as if you guys open the screws Because the mobile phone manufacturers tell you To talk, use Instagram, use Whatsapp, use Facebook Watch Youtube, watch CodeWithHarry videos Do whatever you want. But all those details are abstracted from you. Now the Youtube app How do you know what code it has? It's abstracted from you, it's hidden. So hiding the details. Abstraction means hiding the details. About what has happened and how. Hiding this is called abstraction. Okay? So this is an abstraction. And abstract data type...I dropped my pen. No worries. So this is an abstract data type. Okay? So we have studied arrays ADTs. Now let's discuss an array; what actually is an array? I'll rub away these methods and all I'll clear the board up. And I'll tell you a bit about what an array actually is. Okay? So an array is a collection of elements. Collection of elements. Accessible by an index. I've given this in the notes; so don't worry too much. Accessible by an index. By an index. I'll write a little fast. Scribbled handwriting. But I've written the notes in perfect handwriting. Don't think that the notes are like this; the notes aren't like this. This is only to make you understand that I'm writing fast. So what is an array? Let's see here. Now I told you that the memory layout of the C programme Here there is a code section. Okay? Then what do we have here? We have the initialise and the uninitialise segments. I won't talk about those. Then we have the stack. Okay? Here we have the heap. Okay? Inside the stack, there are local variations of a function. Okay? So you called for a function; then it will have its own stack. In that, if you make an array then it will be here. And you'll get the memory here, in the stack. But the heap, i.e in the dynamic memory... If we use the memory as a resource in the heap of the array, Assume you say that you want an array of 10 elements, Now here 0...1...2...3. Till will go till 9. And the index of the array In most programming languages, starts at 0 It has a reason; when we start from 0, We get a certain advantage but I won't go there. But, you can search on the internet There's a paper by jee-stars You can see; in that they've explained what will happen if it starts from 1 If it starts from 0; how calculations will become easy When we try to access the index ahead. I won't go there. I want to tell you guys, What an array is. Now assume that here...or here You request an array in the heap or in the stack So you get contiguous blocks of memory. Means, that if its address is 50
Or if its address is 10, And I'm assuming an integer, It's an integer of 4 bytes. Okay? There is also a 2-byte integer too But I'm assuming a 4-byte one. It depends on the architecture. 14...18...22...26...this is how the address is. This means, that 4 bytes is one integer. Okay? Here assume this is 6. Here in 4 bytes, there will be one integer. Here in 4 bytes, there will be one integer. And there will be an integer every 4 bytes. Now assume that this is 26...so this will become 30. And along with that, this will be 34. And from here, the other memory's location will start. Which I don't have; it's not under my control And that is 38; okay, and from here the other memory will start. Remember one thing, you cannot resize an array. Because if you resize it, then...you want this memory This memory. Now assume you made this array, Okay? You made this array The compiler will say, "Okay," "From 10 till 38; this block of memory is yours." Okay? And you will get it. Now assume that after some time you go to a shopkeeper, "Uncle please give me this toffee," He says, "Take it," Then you go and you think that this isn't a good toffee. Then you say, "Uncle please take it back," Then he asks, "What's going on? I'm not here to take it back," He gets angry. Okay? So what happens here? Goods once sold can't be returned. Okay? So here, if you say that you don't want 38, you want a greater one Then you won't get it. Why won't you get it? See, when you requested a memory till 38, Then it is possible that some other application was given some memory by the compiler. Okay? It will be doing its job with this memory. Otherwise in the same programme It must have allocated a variable in correspondence with this memory. So now you're saying that you want to increase it So you cannot make it larger in this array. You cannot make it larger in this array. You can increase it in the linked list, we'll talk about that ahead, But you cannot make it larger. Because you've asked for memory till 38, After that who knows who's using the memory ahead of that; It won't be used in every case. The compiler can't even guarantee to increase it That, "I will guarantee that I'll increase it whenever you want or resize it," So for resizing it, what you'll have to Assume the content of this array...1...2...8...12 And assume this is 8...36...42 So you'll have to copy all of this content into a new array. If you want to request a larger array. You'll have to copy all of this content one by one. You can resize it this way. Okay? You can resize it this way. Now if you're making the array in a heap, You can make it in C++ If you are then, you can use the new operator If you're making it in C, then you can make it like this: int*malloc. By the way, if you haven't seen my video about C It's a 15-hour video with notes. Do watch that. Because all these things are needed here. I've told these things very slowly with practice If you skip the practice set, it'll be over in 6 hours. Okay? Do watch that video. I've made you practise a lot in that video. That's why it's taken a lot of time...it's of 15 hours. Malloc, and... assume here I'm doing 10xsize of int. I'll write it like this. 10 multiplied by, i.e star, size of, i.e size of the operator, And inside that int, i.e whatever is the size of int. So assume this is an 'a' pointer, okay? This is an int*a. I have an int*a. And I've pointed it with this. Assume I made an array of size 10, So I'll get 0-9 as my indexes. Indices. Okay? And after that, I want to expand this array. And now I want it from 0-19, That means that I want to store 20 elements in my array, okay? So what will happen? To store 20 elements in the array, What will I do? I'll make another pointer. Int*b=int*malloc(20*size of int) I'll do it like this. And then I'll write, a=b. Okay? I'll point this pointer in this. I can resize it in this way. Directly I cannot resize it, I can't increase it It won't get this block; no. It can be resized this way An array cannot be resized Now, why should we use an array? Why did we make an array? Let's see here. We made the array because Because at one point I have these 10 addresses Then you'll say, "Tell me what the 4th element will be," So here I will count and I will know that this is at a distance of 4 So the fourth element; I'll try to find in one calculation i.e in O(1) time. Listen to me carefully. I will use 10 And after that, I'll write + 4x(i) This will be its address Of the i-th integer. Let's see if I've written it correctly. If I do i=0 here, then I'll get 10. If I do i=1 here, then I'll get 14. I'll write here 0...1...2...3...4...5...6. Now assume that I want to know where the 5th element is. I want the address of the fifth element; As in I need 30. What I'll do is; I'll put 5 here 5x4=20; 20+10=30. So I'll directly get the address and I'll be able to access it. So there is faster access in an array. It's not like if I want to access this then I'll have to come from all the way here adding the pointer. So this traversal; if I'd made it with a variable or linked list or in any other way, I would have needed it on O(1). Now my work is done in O(1). Oops. My work is done in O(1); in constant time. I can access the elements of the array in O(1) time; in contact time. Okay? So this is benefitting me a lot; I can access anything faster This Get method runs very fast. This Set method also runs very fast. Because I can reach wherever I want to go. I'll directly say that whatever value is at that place, To dereference it and numb its value. Okay? This way I can change the values very quickly. But here there's a scam. What's the scam? I'll tell you. The scam is that if I want to insert an element here, If here I want to insert 5 after 8; So if there isn't large enough, I'll have to make another one. I'll have to copy these elements here, After that, I'll have to keep the new element that I'm inserting. Then I'll have to copy 36 and 42 here. Okay? Then I'll have to copy 36 and 42 here. I'll have to make a new array. But this insertion is becoming costly for me Along with that, if I want to delete something Assume that I don't want 8 here So this deletion will also be costly for me What will I have to do? I'll have to move these elements a bit. It is possible that I'm deleting the first element And the elements left to move inside the array, Those are 'n'. It will take O(n) time to only move them. Okay? And after that, one place will be wasted. Let's not worry too much about that wastage. But after that you can imagine; I'm moving all the elements ahead of it. That operation there will be costly for me. We'll do this one thing now, We'll write Get and Set directly. The programming language gives them to you by default If you've made the array in C language, You can write it like Arr(i) and implement it in Get. And in Set also you can do it the same; write Arr=(numb). So Get and Set is very easy in the C language. But we'll see a few other operations, We'll implement this array ADT with the help of structure. Because it's our choice, how we build our PC. This is our abstract data type. We'll build it however we want to. And we'll add many more operations So that whenever a user is using the array, then they can do so very easily. And they should not have any problems while using array ADT. For example, if he/she goes to 'Add Array' to add two arrays, Now in C language, you'll have to write whatever function or programme that you have to add. But in my ADT I will provide the user with the ability to use my Add method. So that he/she will be able to add lots of arrays directly. Okay? So we implement this thing with the help of structure. I hope ADT is understood. And that array is understood. That why we use arrays. Faster retrieval, faster updation. Where does the scam happen in the array? At the time of deletion and insertion. If I want to insert an element, it becomes costly. Because I'll have to move it; All of this is contiguous memory, right? All these locations are contiguous. And if you say, "Send 8 at the end; bring this here," So it doesn't work like that. I have to maintain the order, And do the insertion after that. There I will face a problem. And if I need more space, Then for that, I'll have to make another array. I'll have to copy everything in that. So that's why we use an array; because there are certain advantages to that. There are some disadvantages too, but it varies from use case to use case. When I use it; when I don't. It depends from problem to problem. And you'll get that by practising. And I will ensure that you get it. Now here I'd like to say something, These notes for array, I'll give them to you. I've written ADT and array pretty well. Now I'll show you the notes, And along with that, If you haven't accessed my data structures playlist, Then please do so. And also, I'm posting a lot of content on Instagram these days, If you haven't followed me on Instagram, then do so. Anytime in the future, if there's an update, About the course; if I give any supplementary material or additional problems. So if something happens, I update it on Instagram quickly. So you can check it out. The link is in the description. Now let's check out the notes about ADTs and Arrays. And after that, we'll practise a bit. We'll write some methods; and understand this topic in depth. So guys this is the PDF that I've written for you guys. And with these handwritten PDFs, you'll at least come to know what an abstract data type is What an array is; so here I've defined it well, All you need to remember is In an abstract data type, abstraction means hiding the implementation details. And you are being given an assurance; a provision To carry out these operations. Now there is some minimal functionality, Like Get, Set; I want all of these things in this. But here along with some minimal functionality, There are a set of operations that will be there in this abstract data type. Now I have defined array as an ADT. Its implementation can be done in various programming languages. Array ADT holds a collection of elements It can float, it can be int, it can be classes in C++, and it can be structure in C language. This means that there should be similar elements. The items should be similar. It can't be that one is int and the other is float. I've told this to you in the array. If you guys don't know the array in C language, Then I'll show you which video to watch. I've made a 15-hour video of the C language, You have to watch it. Everything will be clear in that. Learn C with 15 hours and notes; I've told everything in here. I'll just say one thing; the reason why it's 15 hours long Because in it I've made you do a lot of practice programmes and projects. That took a lot of time. But if you look at the concepts, I've done the time stamping, guys Down below in the description, If I open this video, you'll find the time stamp So according to that, you can open the chapters and you can skip the practice set. Then even if you have less time, you'll be set. Okay? So here, we saw all these things on the board; I'd like to tell you one more thing, about static and dynamic arrays. Static arrays are those whose size cannot be changed. But dynamic arrays are those whose size can be changed. Now you'll say, "We just talked about how the size of an array can't be changed in C language." But we can make an ADT, i.e an abstract data type That will implement this functionality. The functionality of dynamic arrays. How will it be in the C language? You can copy the previous elements into the new elements. So we can make an abstract data type of a dynamic array. And that will implement this feature. Okay? So here I have given a quick quiz, To code all the operations for the ADT that I've made Max, Min, Search, Insert and Append. To implement all of these. We'll do this in a while; I've told you about memory representation sufficiently. That the array can be accessed and updated in O(1) time. Because only one calculation has to be done And it will take constant time, regardless of if you're updating the element Or if you want to access it from there. It depends on you and what you want to do. I've written here index 0..1...2...3 It's a contiguous memory location, so from here it will have 10 memory address From here it will have from 10-14 From here it will have from 14-18 From here it will have from 18-22 From here it will have from 22-26. It's 4 bytes each; in every bite, there are 8 bits. In every bit, 0 or 1 is stored. So the computer only speaks in the language of 0 or 1. Here I won't go into too much detail; If you want to know those types of details, I've made a practice playlist of the C language. Here too, videos are going to be added. So you can watch this; if you really want to know all these things, Binary to decimal; decimal to binary, bit operations and Different types of practice programmes for the C language. I've made a separate playlist for that. So you can watch this; I'll be adding a lot of videos here. But if you want to stick to data structures All I'll say is keep following this course And you will definitely like it and it will benefit you a lot. So that is it for this video guys. I hope you have accessed this playlist of data structures. If you haven't then please do and bookmark this playlist. And I want to request you that please; I'm working very hard for this course specifically So if it's possible, please share the videos. I don't think it takes a lot of time to share Simply take the link and forward it to your WhatsApp groups of school, college, or wherever you work. If you do this then it will help me a lot, and I'll bring more of these courses for free with notes. And there are many more things that I'm planning, And if you want to make things easier for me, Please share it as much as you can. Thank you so much guys for watching this video, And I will see you next time.`}],kO=[{video_id:"ukzFI9rgwfU",title:"Machine Learning | What Is Machine Learning? | Introduction To Machine Learning | 2024 | Simplilearn",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU",duration:472,transcript:"we know humans learn from their past experiences and machines follow instructions given by humans but what if humans can train the machines to learn from the past data and do what humans can do and much faster well that's called machine learning but it's a lot more than just learning it's also about understanding and reasoning so today we will learn about the basics of machine learning so that's paul he loves listening to new songs he either likes them or dislikes them paul decides this on the basis of the song's tempo genre intensity and the gender of voice for simplicity let's just use tempo and intensity for now so here tempo is on the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast whereas intensity is on the y axis ranging from light to soaring we see that paul likes the song with fast tempo and soaring intensity while he dislikes the song with relaxed tempo and light intensity so now we know paul's choices let's say paul listens to a new song let's name it as song a song a has fast tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies somewhere here looking at the data can you guess whether paul will like the song or not correct so paul likes this song by looking at paul's past choices we were able to classify the unknown song very easily right let's say now paul listens to a new song let's label it as song b so song b lies somewhere here with medium tempo and medium intensity neither relaxed nor fast neither light nor soaring now can you guess whether paul likes it or not not able to guess whether paul will like it or dislike it are the choices unclear correct we could easily classify song a but when the choice became complicated as in the case of song b yes and that's where machine learning comes in let's see how in the same example for song b if we draw a circle around the song b we see that there are four votes for like whereas one would for dislike if we go for the majority votes we can say that paul will definitely like the song that's all this was a basic machine learning algorithm also it's called k nearest neighbors so this is just a small example in one of the many machine learning algorithms quite easy right believe me it is but what happens when the choices become complicated as in the case of song b that's when machine learning comes in it learns the data builds the prediction model and when the new data point comes in it can easily predict for it more the data better the model higher will be the accuracy there are many ways in which the machine learns it could be either supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning let's first quickly understand supervised learning suppose your friend gives you one million coins of three different currencies say one rupee one euro and one dirham each coin has different weights for example a coin of one rupee weighs three grams one euro weighs seven grams and one dirham weighs four grams your model will predict the currency of the coin here your weight becomes the feature of coins while currency becomes the label when you feed this data to the machine learning model it learns which feature is associated with which label for example it will learn that if a coin is of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin let's give a new coin to the machine on the basis of the weight of the new coin your model will predict the currency hence supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model here the machine knew the features of the object and also the labels associated with those features on this note let's move to unsupervised learning and see the difference suppose you have cricket data set of various players with their respective scores and wickets taken when you feed this data set to the machine the machine identifies the pattern of player performance so it plots this data with the respective wickets on the x-axis while runs on the y-axis while looking at the data you'll clearly see that there are two clusters the one cluster are the players who scored higher runs and took less wickets while the other cluster is of the players who scored less runs but took many wickets so here we interpret these two clusters as batsmen and bowlers the important point to note here is that there were no labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the learning with unlabeled data is unsupervised learning so we saw supervised learning where the data was labeled and the unsupervised learning where the data was unlabeled and then there is reinforcement learning which is a reward based learning or we can say that it works on the principle of feedback here let's say you provide the system with an image of a dog and ask it to identify it the system identifies it as a cat so you give a negative feedback to the machine saying that it's a dog's image the machine will learn from the feedback and finally if it comes across any other image of a dog it will be able to classify it correctly that is reinforcement learning to generalize machine learning model let's see a flowchart input is given to a machine learning model which then gives the output according to the algorithm applied if it's right we take the output as a final result else we provide feedback to the training model and ask it to predict until it learns i hope you've understood supervised and unsupervised learning so let's have a quick quiz you have to determine whether the given scenarios uses supervised or unsupervised learning simple right scenario one facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs scenario 2 netflix recommends new movies based on someone's past movie choices scenario 3 analyzing bank data for suspicious transactions and flagging the fraud transactions think wisely and comment below your answers moving on don't you sometimes wonder how is machine learning possible in today's era well that's because today we have humongous data available everybody is online either making a transaction or just surfing the internet and that's generating a huge amount of data every minute and that data my friend is the key to analysis also the memory handling capabilities of computers have largely increased which helps them to process such huge amount of data at hand without any delay and yes computers now have great computational powers so there are a lot of applications of machine learning out there to name a few machine learning is used in healthcare where diagnostics are predicted for doctor's review the sentiment analysis that the tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting application of machine learning fraud detection in the finance sector and also to predict customer churn in the e-commerce sector while booking a gap you must have encountered surge pricing often where it says the fair of your trip has been updated continue booking yes please i'm getting late for office well that's an interesting machine learning model which is used by global taxi giant uber and others where they have differential pricing in real time based on demand the number of cars available bad weather rush r etc so they use the surge pricing model to ensure that those who need a cab can get one also it uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with the goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing can be minimized great hey siri can you remind me to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll remind you thanks no problem comment below some interesting everyday examples around you where machines are learning and doing amazing jobs so that's all for machine learning basics today from my site keep watching this space for more interesting videos until then happy learning"},{video_id:"KNAWp2S3w94",title:"Intro to Machine Learning (ML Zero to Hero - Part 1)",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNAWp2S3w94",duration:438,transcript:`♪ (music) ♪ You've probably heard a lot
about AI machine learning over the last few months. And maybe you've been inspired
by videos showing what's possible with AI machine learning. But what is it really? Once you go beyond the hype
and get down to writing code, what does AI really look like? Well, that's what we're going
to go through in this video series, where we'll teach you what it's like
to write code for machine learning, and how it provides different,
new, and exciting scenarios that will help you write applications that behave more like a human being,
giving you artificial intelligence. I'm Laurence,
and I'm going to be your guide. You don't need
to know a lot to get started, and we'll be using the Python language. Don't worry if you've never used it,
it's super simple to understand, and you'll be up and running in no time. So let's start with a very simple example. Consider you're creating a game
of Rock, Paper, Scissors. When you play this
with a human, it's very basic; every child can learn it
in just a few minutes. Now, let's take a look
at the most basic part of a game that the human brain is really good at, and that's recognizing
what it's actually looking at. So consider these images. Most people can look at them
and instantly recognize which ones are rock, which ones are paper, and which ones are scissors. But how would you program
a computer to recognize them? Think about all of the diversity
of hand types, skin color, and even people who do scissors
like me, with their thumb sticking out, and people who do scissors
with their thumb in. If you've ever written any kind of code,
you'll instantly realize that this is a really,
really difficult task. It might take you thousands
or tens of thousands of lines of code, and that's just to play
rock, paper, or scissors. So what if there was
a different way to teach a computer to recognize what it sees? What if you could have
a computer learn in the same way that a human does? That's the core of machine learning
and the path to artificial intelligence. So traditional programming
looks like this. You have data, for example,
a feed from the webcam, and you have rules that act on this data. These rules are expressed
in a programming language and are the bulk
of any code that you write. Ultimately, these rules will act
on the data and give you an answer. Maybe it sees a rock,
maybe it sees a paper, and maybe it sees scissors. But what if you turn this diagram around, and instead of you as the programmer
figuring out the rules, you instead give
it answers with the data and have the computer
figure out what the rules are. That's machine learning. So now, I can have
lots of pictures of rocks and tell a computer
that this is what a rock looks like, and this is what paper looks like, and this is what scissors looks like. And I can have a computer
figure out the patterns that match them to each other. Then, my computer will have learned
to recognize a rock, paper, and scissors. That's the core of building something
that uses machine learning. You get a set of data
that has patterns inherent in it, and you have a computer learn
what those patterns are. Before we write a neural network that learns something as complex
as rock, paper, and scissors, let's use a much simpler example. Take a look at these numbers-- there's a relationship
between the X and Y values. Can you see it? It's actually Y = 2X - 1. So if you saw it, how did you get that? Maybe you noticed
that the Y value increases by 2, while the X value only increases by 1. So it was Y = 2X 
plus a minus something. And then, you may have seen
that when X was zero, Y was minus one, so you figured Y = 2X - 1
would be a good guess, and then you took a look
at the other numbers and saw that it worked. That's exactly the principle
that all machine learning works on. So let's take a look. This is the entire code that you can use
to create a machine-learned model that figures out what matches
these numbers to each other. Don't worry if some of it
doesn't look very familiar right now, you'll be able to pick that up in no time. This first line defines the model itself. A model is a trained neural network, and here we have
the simplest possible neural network, which, in this case, is a single layer
indicated by the keras.layers.Dense code. And that layer has a single neuron in it,
indicated by units = 1. We also feed a single value
into the neural network, which is the X value, and we'll have the neural network
predict what the Y would be for that X. So that's why we just say
that input_shape is one value. When you compile the model, 
there are two functions: the loss and the optimizer. These are the key to machine learning. How machine learning works
is that the model will make a guess about the relationship
between the numbers. For example, it might guess
that Y = 5X + 5. And when training, it will then calculate how good or how bad that guess is,
using the loss function. And then, it will use
the optimizer function to generate another guess. The logic is that the combination
of these two functions will slowly get us closer and closer
to the correct formula. And, in this case, it will go through
that loop 500 times, making a guess, calculating
how accurate that guess is, and then using the optimizer
to enhance that guess, and so on. The data itself is set up
as an array of Xs and Ys, and our process
of matching them to each other is in the fit method of the model. We literally say, "fit the Xs
to the Ys and try this 500 times." When it's done,
we'll have a trained model. So now you can try to predict
a Y value for a given X. What do you think would happen
if you tried this line of code predict the Y when X equals 10? You might think
that the answer is 19, right? But it isn't. It's actually something like 18.9998. It's close to 19,
but it's not quite there. Why do you think that would be? Well, the computer was trained
to match only six pairs of numbers. It looks like a straight-line relationship
between them, for those six, but it may not be a straight line
for values outside of those six. There's a very high probability
that it's a straight line, but we can't be certain. And this probability is built
into the prediction, so it's telling us a value very close 
to 19, instead of exactly 19. Try the code out using the link
in the description below this video to see it for yourself. This is something you'll see
a lot more of in machine learning. And in the next video in this series,
we'll take what you've learned and apply that
to a more interesting problem-- computer vision-- and seeing how you can
teach a computer to see things, using exactly the same methodology
as you used here. We'll see you in that video, and don't forget to hit

topic or an experienced ml practitioner looking to brush up on an area we're happy to have you join us this course is based on the free open source 26 lesson ml for beginners curriculum from Microsoft which can be found at AKA dot Ms slash ml-beginners machine learning is one of the most popular Technologies these days I'm sure you've heard this term if you have any sort of familiarity with technology no matter what domain you work in however the mechanics of machine learning are a mystery to most people and the subject can sometimes feel overwhelming in this course you'll start right from the beginning and you'll learn about it step by step to practical Hands-On coding examples let's start by talking about the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning AI is a science of getting machines to accomplish tasks that typically require human level intelligence many different techniques have been proposed for AI but the most successful and popular approach these days is machine learning unlike other AI techniques ml uses specialized algorithms to make decisions by learning from data so machine learning is really a subset of artificial intelligence you've also probably heard of deep learning which is a subset of machine learning that relies on neural networks to learn from data in this course we're going to cover what we call classical machine learning you'll learn some Core Concepts of ml a bit of History statistical techniques like regression classification clustering and more the concepts you'll learn here will serve you well as you progress to more Advanced Techniques keep in mind that this course won't cover data science deep learning neural networks and AI techniques other than ml Microsoft offers two additional courses for you to learn more about these areas data science for beginners available at AKA dot Ms slash data science beginners and AI for beginners available at aka.ms Ai and beginners machine learning is a Hot Topic because it's solving complex real-world problems in so many areas Finance earth science space exploration cognitive science and many more Fields have adopted machine learning to solve problems specific to their domains for example you can use machine learning to predict the likelihood of disease from a patient's medical history to anticipate weather events to understand the sentiment of a text and to detect fake news and stop the spread of propaganda applications of machine learning are almost everywhere and are as ubiquitous as the data that is Flowing from our devices and systems because of how useful it is understanding the basics of machine learning is going to help you no matter what domain you're coming from in the next video in the series I'll give an overview of the history of ml I'll see you there"},{video_id:"L1WXekOFBpc",title:"Introduction to Machine Learning | ML Basics for Beginners",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1WXekOFBpc",duration:4086,transcript:"so as I have already said the today's agenda so I have saved time that's why I have taken you know prior to the class I don't want to waste my time while writing inside the class because you know lot of uh things that we need to discuss as part of today's agenda okay so anyhow this is the introduction class I have already given the uh heading as introduction to ml ml is nothing but stands for machine learning okay we'll uh see what is that machine learning and all then uh going forward also we'll see what is linear regression and anyhow I'm not going to complete the entire linear regression in today's class it is a part one session I mean the first some part will cover and I'll continue uh rest of the part in the next session and we will complete there itself fine so as part of today's class we'll discuss about the entire AI Universe uh okay what is AI and all we'll discuss nothing to be worry then introduction to mchine learning then horological structure of machine learning algorithm then we'll discuss about regression line what is regression line and all several types of regression model analysis types of linear regression model uh visual plot of regression model then best fit line how to draw best fit line we'll talk about that then we'll talk about some important matrices evaluation matrices that is residual sum of squares is RSS then we'll talk about what is gradient what is cost function okay then we'll talk about uh strength of simple linear regression then we'll see some formula about you know residual square of resal square error sum of square then RSS TSS R square everything we'll see okay so one by one we'll see so let me let me hold my you know markers and let's start a journey okay fine so first one is AI Universe okay so let me just write down so yeah first one okay let me choose my favorite color Al together yeah no how is got change I want black color is it no this is gray where is black who CH by number okay fine not an issue AI Universe guys uh you might have heard about lot of terminology nowadays which is revolved around the data okay whenever you are talk we are talking about mine learning before entering to mine learning learning uh we have to understand what is this ai ai stands for let me go from the basic even though you know please bear with me don't feel boring sir we know this thing that's fine because most of the people they don't know also first time they're hearing what is ai ai stands for artificial intelligence and any I have written ml stands for M learning which we are going to learn the entire uh syllabus okay and you might have heard about there another terminology called DL DL me not not driving license okay driving license people are thinking driving license no no no it's not driving license d stand for deep learning deep learning okay let's try to understand where we exist exactly then we'll enter into the our subtopic or the exact topic that is Meine learning so if I draw if I will draw a set diagram or kind of pin diagram then I can easily explain where exactly we stand if I tell the AI universe is nothing but the entire universe of the AI world is like this which is nothing but AI the subset of AI is nothing but the M learning mL no doubt I'll show you a beautiful diagram for that just I'm explaining by taking my white Bo okay then I can say the subset of Miss learning is nothing but DL that is deep learning that means if I tell DL which is present inside ml I mean ml encapsulate DL and ml again recites inside AI that's why I've given the heading as AI Universe means enter World because AI contains both A and D and no doubt in between there lot of things are there you know need to try to understand for time being going forward obviously as part of the knowledge I can tell you for time being but you need to understand again as part of the DL we have something called ji okay generative A J AI which stands for generative generative AI okay AI stands for again artificial intelligence and so if I draw then again it is subset of D so I can write J J fine any it's not required for us out of the syllabus for timeing okay for us we are not going to learn here J and D okay so where we res if I ask could you please tell me where we res we reses here exactly exactly here so we'll try to learn what are the related things related to ml not to DL not to jna not to the enter AI also so because when I'm telling ml few algorithm will be there which is related to ml lot many other will be there which are related to DL maybe yeah certain things are there which are related to artificial intelligence some fancy color I'm choosing today I don't know which color it is okay so then let me choose some different color yeah any there is no space okay jna also something like this so don't think that we are trying to learn all the things enter within this two month or three month or maybe after your you know post semester exam nothing like that we are just giving focusing on learning the ml part like the red color area you can see what are the things related to M learning only there itself we learn a lot forget about other things because that is a key point of each and everything you nowadays you might have had okay mine learning engineer lot of profiles are related to that so we have something called we have something called M let me change the color yeah M there's a profile called M that is called machine learning in short I'm writing machine learning engineer then there is something called you might have heard about DS it stands for it's very famous One data scientist okay then data related other profiles I can say that's something called [Music] da stands for data analyst okay then we have something called Data engineer but that's again a different story Al together okay then in uh related to M I can say machine learning we have something called mlops ml OBS so what is mlops uh people uh generally the traditional you know before data science come the market you know right people who are working in the software industry they are claiming them as a software developer or software engineer right yes see okay now I talking about before uh data science come into the market generally people who are working in a software industry they claiming this thems as a software developer software engineer software so let me write software engineer right or you can say software developer so whenever you join in the industry you get to know I'm just giving overall idea whenever you join an industry let's say as a developer your work is to develop an application software application once you develop people who are working in testing team their work is to test the application that you develop or developed by the developer once that is complete it will go to the production phase so who will deploy the production for that there is a dedicated separate team those team people are called devops DB OBS OBS Dev devops is nothing but a combination of two different word that is called development d v l o p m n development plus op Ops OP stand for operation o p e r a t i o n so this is for normal developmental software application so let's say this is my software application okay my software [Music] software application similarly nowadays a new com to the market or new profile Comm Market related to data science and all or mine learning I can say so people who are working in mine learning they call as they call thems as M like as I have already written above right in the above mle M that is nothing but M learning machine learning engineer e n g i n e e r machine learning engineer okay who is thinking F okay machine learning engineer now once as a machine learning engineer you develop the machine learning application not that is not the normal software application that is a machine learning application then again it will move to the test in page or the people who are working as a tester they will test it once it will complete then it will move to the production page the team which is responsible to move your machine learning application to production phase that is called those team people they claim themselves as mlops engineer what is the full form of mlops is again combination of two different work machine learning ml ml plus Ops ml stands for mine learning M learning and off stand for operation operations operations similarly if I draw the diagram if I draw the diagram so it will be not normal not your normal software application it is a m learning application machine learning application or software application clear guys so these are the profile different different job role if you know M learning you can become a m you can become a data scientist obviously for data analys not required because data analys little bit lower uh designation I mean I can say lower grade designation that data scientist and you can become ml but to become a mlop in addition to machine learning operation or machine learning language you need some operational operation operational knowledge to deploy it for example like you know Dockers cuet uh aw Hemer for if I go to the cloudbase right aw Hemer GTH of Docker then GTH of action lot many things airflow lot many other tools you have to know to become a mlops but to become a machine learning engineer if you know machine learning and some sort of let's say SQL uh some programming language like Python and then I can say let's say some visualization tool like table or power that is more than enough to become a m learning engineer clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far so uh yeah we have already completed AI universe and we have also completed introduction to machine learning and LW now let's come back to hierarchical structure of M Learn okay so this is a point one I can write so this is the point two also I have completed anyhow here introduction to M learning I'll go through officially not an issue so this is my point to introduction to [Music] Miss Lear I'll go a little bit in depth while sharing my PP okay don't worry for second point and I'll show I'll show you lot of beautiful diagram related to point number one okay let me just explain first try to understand then I'll go through my PP so that you it will feel easy to see it and to observe it okay now Point number three iCal structure of machine learning algorithm okay in short I'm just writing okay or shall I write all the things okay okay let me write hcal structure of in short I'm writing machine learning algorithm M algorithm okay guys coming to mine learning it is of different type to solve different different problem statement different different problem State I got a B sound let me see just one me see yeah okay now we use mine learning to solve different different problem statement what are those let's try to understand one by one okay now coming to different type of M learning we have something called supervised s supervised mine learning algorithm then we have something called all supervised [Music] [Music] unsupervised machine learning algorithm what is supervised machine learning what is unsupervised machine learning what is the difference between that everything will discuss in depth nothing to be worried just just focus on my watch okay just follow me okay now guys Frankly Speaking In addition to these two different classes also there's a one more classes present I mean if you follow the official website or any books you'll definitely find so for that sake for knowledge sake I'm just giving but that is not that much important that's not required for you right now that's why not to confuse you I'm not writing here now I'm just telling you only two things but for a knowledge sake if you ask me sir is it like machine learning algorithm is of two types are you sure no then for that I'm just writing for knowledge sck guys okay so that nobody should you know blame me in the future or they can come back sir you told two types but in the books it's written three types or maybe in the internet I have seen somewhere in the website is three typ for that knowledge check only I'm writing there is something called reinforcement reinforcement learning learning okay what is reinforcement learning that is not of our business that is none of our business and we are not here right now to learn that things that's why don't focus on that just I'm writing for your knowledge check if somebody will ask tell me what type of different machine learning algorith algorithms are there then you can tell we have something called supervised machine learning there's something called unsupervised machine learning then there is something called reinforcement learning but as we are not going to learn as part part of our curriculum I not writing that one I'm not highlighting that one so now you just focus on these two types going forward Mak sense guys now coming to supervis machine learning guys again it is of two types again it is of two types that is something called regression another one is called classification okay regression and classification similarly coming to unsupervised machine learning it is of again two types again two types one is called clustering and there is something called uh dimensionality reduction technique Dimension m n d i o n dimensionality reduction reduction technique t c n i q generally we call this part as kind of you know advance advance ad advance machine learning algorithms and all okay algorithms and all okay algorithms and all okay guys Frankly Speaking as part of your curriculum in the sense like as part of your semester exam we are going to discuss are complete in depth all these three as I have notified I hope if I'm not wrong before your semester midterm exam we are going to complete the regression algorithm and classification algorithm then after your midterm exam then we are going to complete in extensively clustering algorithm as okay I'm not sure whether we are going to complete or not I have to go through again the syllabus and okay but I'm able to recall I hope this three I'm sure okay we are going to before midterm this two after midterm maybe this one or maybe they have included based your curriculum that I need to cross check one more time fine guys now so these are just the name what is regression what is classification what is clustering everything will discuss nothing to be wor okay nothing to now generally whenever I'm telling guys regression algorithm what do you mean by that that means there are certain algorithm given by the researcher or scientist by using which we can solve a problem statement which is a regression problem statement so if I write down example for example regression so sir can I can you give example of regression algorithm yes so let me write down something like linear regression linear regression okay linear regression how I'm writing okay then we have something called multiple multiple regression multiple simp regression any this is simple regression because again linear regression divide into two types simple linear regression and multiple linear regression linear regression and all these are the example of regression algorithm similarly coming to classification we have something called uh logistic logistic regression okay okay now coming to clustering uh you know that we'll cover after your exam so it is something like that I think C in clustering if I'm not wrong okay uh kin's clustering uh that is something called hcal clustering okay hierarchical clustering and all so these are the algorithm or the example of that category so if I tell simple linear regression is nothing but algorithm by using which you can solve a regession problem statement if I tell logistic regression is nothing but algorithm by using which you can complete a classification problem statement if I tell what is hcal clustering is nothing but algorithm by using which you can solve a problem statement which is related to clustering problem statement guys clear any doubt so far any doubt so far please please let me know okay so can I mark it I don't think so yeah I can mark it so this is completed this is completed okay now this is a time to go back to my slide okay okay let me see is there any things I have left and in addition that as I have given commitment I'll show you some beautiful diagram related to the point one and we'll discuss something extensively different application of machine learning algorithm what is the life cycle everything later point two and all then point three any I have not draw the needed clean diagram but I'll show you okay give me one minute let me reare let me stop fine is it okay fine now as I told you so this is the entire universe artificial intelligence versus mine learning versus deep learning so where we starts exactly you can figure it out by seeing this beautiful diagram the entire universe is artificial intelligence then subset is M Lear which again contains the Deep learning and all now sir could you please show me a kind of diagram where we'll get to know the different text tag that is involved and again we know like gen is the part of deep learning Al together right so let me go to the next slide yeah this is the entire a universe with which I have we have started our classes today you can see artificial intelligence which is I mean again machine learning is a subset and I can say artificial intelligence is the super set then machine learning is a softs set then again neural Network then we have something called Deep learning then inside deep learning we have something called generative AI don't Focus any other thing just focus on machine learning area let me maximize it guys what are things written here are you able to see there is something called regression if you I'm not wrong let me maximize it's possible yeah is possible regression that is something called classification that is something called clustering yes or no in addition of that there's something called reinforcement l learning right and this is the part of like supervised learning unsupervised learning that I have already categor I'll show you another diagram okay don't worry about all the things these are the advanced Meine learning technique like as I told you let's say classification right I have written in my whiteboard logistic regession now one person can ask me is it like only one algorithm that is logistic regression is present to solve classification problems no in addition to that multiple lot of other algorithms are present what are those if I tell that those are nothing but that is something called decision tree there is something called random Forest there is something called egg boost ad boost lot of other things are there supp Vector machine as well so these are the things written here and here you can see diality reduction technique which I have also written my white so here and there they just written in a random manner but I have written in a sequential manner how we proceed or how we study one by one step by step okay but all the things are present here nothing to be wor other part because that is not part of our curriculum for timing just focus on this machine learning Area machine learning area clear clear guys any doubt so any doubt so now let's go to the next slide what is machine learning definition so according to Tom Mitchell which is nothing but a computer scientist in us okay obviously he has lot of contribution in the machine learning area that's why he is giv a beautiful definition according to him machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience so what is that all the things we learn one by one nothing to so what is telling mchine learning is nothing but the study of computer algorithm that allow computer program to automatically improve through experience how it improves and all that will see one by one let's proceed now human versus computer guys try to understand how things are working behind the scene generally in case of human being first we will focus on human being how human being things process and execute or convert into action then similar stop will just replicate in the computer itself I think about a human being take the decision based upon the past experience correct or not computer can create model by using the data like how a human being a person take the decision based upon the experience similarly a computer create the model based on the data set giv data set or input data set so you can see a human being just thinking okay I make decision based upon the experience my past experience right now now computering I make model based on the data so whatever data will give me I'll train it I'll build the models I'll learn from it okay everything we see one by one now see humans follow this formula all human are used to follow some pattern or formulas to take the next best action first remember then formulate then predict okay generally we remember past situation that we are similar we formulate a general rule we formulate a general rule then we use this rule to predict what will happens if we take a certain decision for example okay I'm give you example that you will be clear 100% okay let me maximize it example for suppose to answer for a question like will it rain today or not just simply question I'm asking guys please tell me will it rain today or not then we will follow one process to answer this question right what is that process we maybe right or wrong that different case because for example in our class totally 52 to 55 students are there if I ask the same question will it run today or not it's not like that all the 52 students will tell or 55 students will tell no sir it will not run R some people will tell yes it may R some people say no it will not r i mean answer may be correct right or wrong that is different story but at least we are trying to make an accurate prediction what is that prediction now based upon my past experience what experience I have G it rain most of the day last week for example last week all almost all the days from last Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and all every day most you are seeing it's raining so it rain most of the day last week now you're thinking I think it rains most of the time not only just last week most of the time it's not like that just 15 minutes R then another 23 hours uh let's say 45 minutes does not R nothing like that almost all the time continuous raining due to know cycl condition and all whether different bad weather condition and all then you will predict it will probably rain today also why because you are seeing from last seven days the weather condition is too bad it's raining almost 24 by7 almost 24 by7 then there is a high chances there it may rain today that's why while going outside you can see there a prediction okay it may rain today so let me carry my umbrella with me that's why it's carrying the umbrella with me noway maybe umbrella or R Whatever May but purpose it's carrying umbrella with him understand this is the remember he remember it then formulate then based upon the formula he predict he or she predict it may rain today also clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far now now let's move to the next how to Meine think now it's go up to you know human being how human being thinks first remember then formulate okay after formulate predict similarly how does me m the goal is to make the computer thing the way we think namely how we use the remember formulate and predict framework three different component guys nothing else remember formulate predict remember means you have to just remember something formulate means you are just creating certain formula based upon that past experience then predict you have to predict based on the future that's here at the point what the computer does in each of the step what are the steps first remember how we are remembering for that computer looks at the given huge data set now formulate how human being is doing the formulate now for computer it is going through Rule and formulas and check which one which one which fits the data so best fit model we discuss everything which model we have to fit here that depends upon the problem statement like as I told you if you are going to solve a regression problem statement No Doubt you have to use either simple linear regression or multiple linear regression or some other regression algorithm as well for example you are going to solve the classification problem statement then you are going to use either logistic regression or decision Tre or random forest or exib and so on okay that's why it's telling which pit means which algorithm pit for that data set only now predict use the rule to make prediction about future data so how a human being is doing prediction similar whatever the rule computer machine has created that rule he has to fit on top of the unknown data set to make prediction about the future real time example Gmail application banking loan application or credit card eligibility for example you have appli for credit card whether you are a eligible person whether they will sanction a credit card for you or not they will dispatch a credit card for you or not for that in the behind the they running a machine learning algorithm whether you are genuine person or frud person whether bank will give loan to you or not so eligibility criteria they seeing or not guys you might have apply for the loan let's say study loan and all anyhow a bank they don't give loan directly to us to you obviously it may be a joint account between your parents and you then uh they are the I can say guar obviously and the bank is giving loan study loan to you okay because you don't have back up you canot so okay this is my income so this is my backup these are my asset So based upon that give me some loan no nobody will give loan like like that fine now introduction to machine learning let's look at some us cases where machine learning model are used we'll also look at the relationship between variable you know so modeling so this is a kind of deep learning algorithm guys and Just sh in the picture so it's a object detection I'm nothing to wor for knowledge I'm just telling when you go for you know higher study obviously in the next semester or maybe the in the future when learn the Deep learning so at the time there is a concept called object detection so by using object detection wherever the cards are there you can see there rectangular box I'm just you know donating or I'm just creating to detect it saying that okay this is my object this is my object object in the sense here I'm trying to predict only the car object not other things in a it can be anything object human being or maybe a dog that may be object right but here my intention is to predict only car that's why for me here car is the object that's why you can see that a rectangular box just around surrounding the car only this kind of object detection similarly go to the next one okay guys any doubt so far any doubt so far please let me know you can see another example let's say predicting requirement of Emergency Services you can see let's say there are four beds are there in the hospital that maybe due to emergency more than four people may came like you know maybe five people or six people make came at the time then how to manage that it's not like that you will tell okay he's the richest person give bed to them he's the poorest person okay let them sleep on the floor no nothing like that right so how to manage them and it's not like that you have to always keep 10 B sorry 100 beds always no it's also in West because 100% are not coming as emergency basis uh at a time right so how to predict that that also for prediction uh predicting also we are using M learning algorithm and not obviously whenever we get into doing any project we get to okay now okay now I just talking about different kind of machine learning which I have already written in my whiteboard hcal structure of machine learning you can see there is something called supervised machine learning there is something called unsupervised machine learning there is something called reinforcement learning but so forget about that now focus on this so coming to supervis mey learning we have something called regression and classification coming to unsupervised machine learning we have something called cluster okay as I have told you for knowledge s there's something called you know dimensionality reduction technique and okay just few times before okay I have seen somebody as a message as a beautiful concept sir no no sir coming to supervise sir in addition to regression and classification we have something called time series and all yes guys that is also true but not to confuse you I'm not keeping all the things so he's telling so three types nothing like three types in addition that we have something called recommendation system okay we have something called recommendation system as well so it's not only time series not only classification not only regression we have something called recommendation system time series forecasting so recommendation system forecasting time series obviously regression classification and all lot many things are there so nothing to be worri don't be confused that is again is just a kind of you know Advanced thing on the extended things of this regression problem statement and all but the basic core concept is regression problem statement if you know how to solve a regression problem statement then whether it's a Time based or non-time based means if it a Time based that time series based regression problem statement if it's not time based normal regression problem statement that's all but if you understand regression problem statement doesn't matter whether a Time series based or non time series based happily you can solve that problem St okay clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far now we can see so what kind of problem statement we are going to solve as part of the miss learning so for that I'm giving an example let's say the three main category of machine learning model are based on the type of the task they perform and the nature of the output the regession model are used for predicting a continuous variable such as the price of a house based upon the factor such as size and the proximity to school so how far from it is school the distance and based upon the you know Square fet size or area so price will be decided so whenever the price will be decided this a kind of regression problem step why because you are going to trade a continuous variable or continuous output okay you can see similarly here also another example last year data so X math score so is kind of percentage like the attendance and all similarly if I give this year current year X math score can you predict the percentage I mean the percentage of what like attendance and all yes that also we can do this is another example of regression problem statement and all okay any we'll solve a definitely good regression problem statement in the class itself okay nothing to be wor I will explain each and everything now we can see it's a kind of classification problem statement how for example a mail is coming guys you might have seen sometimes a male is coming to a mail is coming Gmail is coming mail is coming to a Gmail sometimes it is there in the inbox you might have seen sometimes going to spam folder that is a folder called spam folder guys you know why it's is going to spam folder because behind the scene Google they have written a m algorithm a kind of classification problem statement if they found out any harmful things in that male which is not which is little suspicious then the algorithm itself predict hey that is some a kind of junk mail or that it's not something something is a you know fish in this mail could you please move that mail to spam folder not to inbox folder are you might have seen while opening is also giving a warning message it may harm your system or achievement will you like to move to inbox if you click okay me you are giving permission at the time it's going to inbox otherwise it will be there in the spam better not to open because nowadays lot of false things are happening you can simply delete make it move to th and maybe permanent deletion and all so that is nothing but a classification model is working behind the scene to distinguish between whether it's a good mail or spam mail H mail spam mail or H mail at all you can see okay email you are opening in the mobile phone account clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far now so let me explain what is the SP and so Gmail application basically Gmail is the very wellknown example of we are all known about spam folder too before I was telling the same things spam folder is nothing but it's just a common term used for junk or unwanted email such as know Chain Letter promotion and so on how is not equ it is the common term used for non-spam mail mean useful maale which is generally called as inbox I mean that is no folder name called H you might have seen inbox right so H is nothing but which is not the spam okay in this scenario mine learning algorithm is working to filter spam or not machine learning algorithm understand the previous mail data based upon the previous mail create some models these models applies on upcoming males and predict whether it is a spam or not now another application banking loan application also like to Samsung a loan to give a credit card or not for that also banking in the banking system also nowadays they are running the machine learning algorithm the banking loan application this is very common application of everyone knows once we applied for loan by submitting required documents data like you know pay SLE past six month bank statement Etc your kyc like AAR card pan pan card details each and everything right then banking guys will run one application over the given data this is machine learning algorithm this algorithm passes through the data and predict whether the loan or credit card will be sanctioned for you or not you are a eligible person to get that particular you know that particular uh loan or not or credit card or not clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far now in addition that few more application I have written here guys don't think that this is the only application where we use machine learning nowadays each and Everywhere You Close Your Eye you throw the stone wherever it will hit if some tech tech is related to that definitely behind the scene machine learning are using machine learning they're using lot of machine learning algorithms okay some are like know text processing recognization traffic prediction product recommendation self driving car email spam or malware filtering that we have seen sometimes before online fraud detection weather forecasting and prediction is that why machine learning is required is a good question as a human we cannot access huge amount of data manually to process we can train machine learning algorithm by providing huge amount of data now machine learning algorithm travel through this data in in order to learn from data it Cates the model and predict result automatically for new data only technically speaking with the help of historical data machine learning algorithm built a mathematical model that helps in making prediction without being explicitly program we no need to write any expit program like from the scratch I have to run the machine learning algorithm on top of my historical data so that it will build a mathematical model which I will used to predict on the future data itself that is the beauty of mchine learning algorithm and all guys okay today guys I'm trying to you know you know create lot of you know basically I build the why we are here why we want to learn why there is a huge hype in the market like okay all are talking about machine learning machine learning mine learning what is this machine learning all together you might have okay learning we know self study or I am learning I'm studying something mine learning means mine is studying something but how machine learning will machine will study it it is not a human being right open the book and study by or no so as a human being as a programmer as a machine learning engineer you have to train your machine you have to train your computer so that your computer becomes more efficient and they can act they can uh they can behave like a human being clear guys any doubt so far please please let me know any doubt so now clustering yeah with this will complete and go back to my whiteboard and push clustering model again I told you clustering is nothing but group similar data point together without predefined label such grouping users with similar viewings on the streaming set to recommended similar context like clustering nothing but Market customer segmentation you can see let's say the combination of boys and girls I'll tell you could you please make two cluster so first cluster will contains all the GS and cluster will cont all the b or maybe men and Omen okay or maybe I will tell you let's say just cluster is based upon the age range so in between the age 10 to 20 make one cluster 21 to 30 make another cluster then 31 to 40 make another cluster and so on so that may be possible that is called clustering which is comes under on supervised machine learning all together now what is machine learning as we have already discuss machine learning models already discussed so it's Al also written two main category as WR here supervis and unsupervised this is a main category but for knowledge s also I have told you if you you look for any books or any you know internet or maybe any website it's generally three types in addition to supervis and unsupervised there is something called reinforcement learning all together now what is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning guys it's written supervised learning model use label data to train and make prediction such as regression and classification but on supervised learning model on the other hand do not use label data instead focus on discovering pattern and relationship in the data such as clustering algorithm okay what is the label data on you know not labeling data not use the label data that will discuss in dep now for time let's come back to our whiteboard and we'll see guys any doubt so far please let me know okay if I go okay let me write down here so what is what is this supervised machine learning and on Super ma what is the difference actually okay uh reg will come back there's something called there let me write a scroll off supervised ML and another one is called [Music] on supervised Emil okay guys what is supervisor I mean the difference what is the difference gener in supervised machine learning we use the labeled data label data but in case of unsupervised ma algorithm uh we are not using not used labeled data okay not used label data what is label data now any that I'll show you while sharing my PP a beautiful diagrams are there just I'm just explaining for example guys think about label data okay so while giving the training data set or input data set I will tell you uh for example this is my kind of apple okay this is my Apple okay so round symbol so let's say this is my kind of orange okay and what else I can say let's say okay let's see great okay another food so let's say this is a labeling I'm giving okay kind of let's say this apple and this is orange orang orange and this is uh what another food let's say other food other food any food name XYZ okay XY fine so I know before in hand this is apple apple looks like this I know before in hand this looks like orange and I know this looks like XY Z foot so whenever tomorrow I will give you unknown data set for example I will give a data set like this uh and this is my mine learning model right so this is my uh mine learning model okay so it's training actually so after training I'm getting the outut Fantastic so what I'm doing I'm giving unknown data set for example on top of this training model I'll give a data set like this now it will predict and tell oh this happen how because while training it has observe okay Apple let's say apple color looks like this apple shape and size look like this okay Apple you know height width looks like this so based upon that you figure it out oh it looks like similar to Apple not like orange because it's a kind of round shape but not exactly round shape this is some kind of different St but this is not that kind of St so okay so I can figure it out this Apple getting me point so here I'm letting my model know this is my Apple orange this is my XYZ you know vegetable or sorry fruits that's why it's able to figure it out that is only possible in case of you know supervised machine learning which is nothing but we used the regression problem statement or classification problem statement so for regression problem statement and classification problem statement whatever the data set we are giving that is labeled data set only but while coming to unsupervised machine learning which is nothing but clustering clustering we are giving we are giving we are not giving label data set unlabeled data set basically unlabeled unlabeled unlabeled data set we are providing for uh clustering for training for training of a clustering algorithm clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far any I'll show the beautiful diagram you'll be get much clar clear now let's come back to uh you know my what are things we are discussing sometimes before I have just in a beautiful manner pictural manner I have keeping in front of you see supervisor unsupervised learning method supervised machine learning which is nothing but we know kind of recreation and classification there we use the labeled data set that's why in the green color making pick Mark but coming to unsupervised machine learning which we know is nothing but a clustering algorithm we use there we are not using label data set that's why it's you know marking as a red color cross mark clear now what is the other difference I can say Yeah in case of let's say uh okay difference between the regression and classification I can say types of label data again if is label data let's say what kind of level data in case of supervised machine learning now coming to rec problem statement score of a particular student is Predictive Analytics scores it's nothing but continuous but spam or har for past email data is kind of cical it's not a continuous why because you are telling whether it's a good or bad true or false whether it will rain or not I mean yes or no true or false zero or one so kind of categorical data but coming to predictive analytic for example you want to predict what should be the price of a house of a 2bhk in so and so location but don't think that guys 2 bhk house price is same all over the India no it depends upon different different Factor whether it's just roadside or so too far from the roadside whether it's near to your office location or School location or just you know too far from your office and School location and again if it is a 2 bsk tell me the square foot area maybe uh some TOS cab squet area 12200 some TOS cab squet area 1500 and so on if it is too bigger size 1500 the price will be more so the price or the rent price or or maybe purchasing price whatever you are telling it depends on not only one factor depends upon multiple Factor like the location square foot area who is Builder who is town city like Tire one city or Tire two City or Tire three City and all that's why and whatever the price you will get is kind of continuous for example okay so they're telling for 12 sare ft for 2.5 bhk uh let's say uh the cost is around 55 lakhs or or 55 lakhs 60,000 something something like that so it's a kind of Predictive Analytics you are doing which is a continuous value it's not a categorical value you are not doing any classification getting my point guys okay F let's move to the next yeah now you can happily enjoy what I was talking 2 minute before that is label data and UNL data now think about the supervised learning the input data guys are you to see this is a label data okay I have keeping I have taken a different different kind of category or classes of animal you can see there's something called camel I have just lbel it you can see how I'm leveling so I'm keeping one animal okay this is nothing but elephant this is nothing camel this is of cow like similarly how I have given the example of fruits I know this is Apple I know this is orange I know this is banana I know this is papaya or something like that okay then I'm giving as a training data set now supervisor is nothing but is kind of trainer because the algorithm is training on top of the label data set the Dig output what will process so let's say I am giving a kind of let's apple fruit like kind of let's say elant this picture I'm a picture like this anal I'm giving or maybe this camel or this one I'm giving so now my model is predicting oh this picture is nothing but belongs to a category called elephant this picture is nothing but the name is called camel this picture is nothing but the name is called cow then how it is trying to identify the name of that Animal by seeing the picture why because I have given the label data set to train my model that's why while pred even though I'm giving unknown data set but based upon the similarity the characteristics the height because you can see elant let say Okay heavy in weight long tail dig trunk trk is absent for this one and this one so can oh in this animal animal who has strong only so if you give any animal strong or not strong blind you can tell this because in the world apart from Elan no other animal have been TK yes or no let's say teth is kind of let's G elephant kind of teeth is coming out so okay long teeth the elephant oh Cam very tall even taller than elephant also and that a keep kind of kind of I can say sa on top of the chamel right and here you can say cow cow looks like some some patches of the color let's this is black color this is kind of some sand color but this is kind of patch color white black patches and all so this kind of a c getting my point now this is called label data now coming to on super machine learning same things I can do same things but here guys see I am not labeling it I not telling my algorithm this is a chamel this is a elephant this is C I'm not telling I'm just giving randomly so my algorithm does not know whether we this is a elephant this is camel or a dog this is a cow or something else we don't know that's why interpretation unknown output no training data set now algorithm running now processing while processing as part of the output is trying to figure it out based upon the different characteristics what you mean that okay this symbol looks like different from this and this symbol looks like different from this so I'm trying to classify into two three different cluster like this is belongs to one category this is belong to another category this is belong to another category why because neither the shape and size nor the color nor the characteristics High where nothing is matching among them that's why I'm treated them as three different classes or cluster I hope now you are clear see one more time I'm just going back try to observe carefully here what is happening guys I'm giving the label data I'm telling my model hey man this is my camel this is elephant this is a cow so my model observe and try to understand oh aant looks like this okay a cam looks like this okay a cow looks like this okay so while giving the unknown data set you can see it is clear man this is why because while giving the training data set you have told me this is a kind of CH okay then what is that this is elephant why because while training you have given the label data set called as elephant and this is called as cow why because while giving the input data set you are given me telling me this is a cow that's why I also not only giving only pi I'm giving particular name oh this elephant this is camel this is a but guys in the on supervis miss learning I am not telling anything to my model that's why my model is unable to give the name whether we call we should have to call elephant or tiger or giraffe or lion whether we have to call this octopus or dinosaur or or whatever it may be or we have to call cow or dog or snake or whatever it may be we don't know that's why just giving three different classes why because neither the height color characteristics nothing is matching because looks and feel of this picture is different from this looks and feel of this picture is different from this so it consider three different classes all together guys any doubt so far please please let me know any doubt so yeah so clearly I have written here supervis versus unsupervised versus reinforcement forget for time now focus on this supervis data with labeled label data we are giving input data set here for all supervis data without Lael without Lael data set without data we are giv here supervised learning here unsupervised learning gener in case of superv learning what is happening so whatever Target is trying to predict so error will come then again retraining all the things will come finally is kind of mapping mapping in the sense I know this apple if I'm giving a picture or like you know fruits belongs to Apple then it will map belongs to Apple or this belongs to Orange this belongs to Banana this belongs to papaya so this kind of mapping is happening but in case of unsupervised machine learning where I'm giving unlevel data is kind of class it's creating different classes whose class does not know because I am not giv the label data I am not told what name you have to give so just giving different classes without naming there is no name that's why you can see here even the picture is Swing no name is displaying here like okay this elant or cam or because I not giv label letter the same things I'm giving for super machine learning is telling me Oh this belongs to Elephant belongs to chamel this belongs to cow why because the name is MTH with the picture here no math only classes three different classes created that's any doubt guys any doubt so far interesting guys don't worry we solve lot of problem and you will get you know 100% Clarity not okay let me see what is that yeah this thing also I have already dra types of machine learning like supervis and unsupervised coming to supervis we have something called regression then classification coming to all supervis we have something called clustering and diam reduction technique so what is written that's nothing but PCA principal comp analysis A too far higher Advanced machine learning so I don't think so it will be in your part of curriculum nothing to be wor okay we'll definitely cover clustering okay so that is after your you know mid semester exam and then before that we'll definitely cover regression and classification so we have seen today example Al some example Rel to classification that is you know classification of the email what it is a genuine email kind of inbox it should come to inbox or it should go to spam uh folder and coming to regression we are predicting uh it's going to rain or not what should be the house P Price uh belongs to a particular area or is based upon too far from office or School location and all okay clear guys any doubt so far any doubt so far okay now the actual Cinema will start let's let me go back to my white board guys any doubt so far please please

statistic Insight today we are diving into Mission learning one of the most exciting technology shaping our old have you ever wondered how Netflix recommends your favorite shows or how Google translate language in seconds or how self-driving C recognize objects on the roads well that's all powered by Mission learning let's break it down in simple terms first what is Mission learning Mission learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed instead of giving the computer FX set of roles we feed it data and it learns pattern to make decisions example email spam detection Mission learning learns which emails are spam based on patterns like suspicious ODS or unknown centers the next example Voice assistance Siri or Alexa understand speech and respond based on Mission learning models trained on thousands of voice samples coming next types of mission learning there are three main types of mission learning one is supervised learning another one is unsupervised learning and finally reinforcement learning coming to supervised learning the model learn from label data that is input output pairs example predicting house prices based on size location and past sales next one unsupervised learning the model finds patterns in unlabeled data without specific answers example customer segmentation in marketing grouping similar customers based on shopping Behavior and the final one reinforcement learning the model learn learn through Trail and error by receiving rewards for correct actions example self driving cost learning to navigate Road safely and how machine Learning Works the machine learning process involves four key steps first one collecting data and training the model testing and evaluation finally making predictions coming to collecting data machine learning model need large amount of data the need the data might be images text or numbers and the next process training the model the model learns patterns using algorithms like neural network or tation toes and the next process testing and evaluation checking how well the model p performs on new data and the final making predictions the model applies that it learned to real world scenarios example training and image recognition model to identify cats and dogs and next popular machine learning algorithms there are many machine learning algorithms but here are some common ones they are linear regression dries neural networks and K means clustering coming to linear regression used for predicting values example predicting stock prices the formula for linear regression is y = mx + b where y predicted output that is dependent variable X input feature that is independent variable M slope coefficient of the line B intercept where the line crosses the X x-axis for multiple linear regression where there are multiple input variables for that y = to B plus B1 X1 plus B2 X2 so on up to B and xn where y predicted output X1 X2 so on x2 and input features B not intercept B1 B2 up to BN coefficient of each feature next one diation trees like a flowchart for making DS a diation tree that makes diation by splitting data into smaller groups based on conditions it works like a flow chart where each station leads to New Branch until it reaches a final outcome that is Lea note example e IT training yes stay inside no go outside the next one is it Sunny s go outside no stay inside the next one neural networks A system that mimix the human brain to recognize patterns the real time example is facial recognition in smartphones unlocks based on learned facial features and the final one k means clustering group similar data points into K clusters based on patterns the real time example is customer segmentation in e-commerce to recommend product based on shopping behavior and finally applications of machine learning machine learning is everywhere some real world application includes self-driving cars learning to recognize objects and make driving DS facial recognition unlocking phones with face ID fraud detection Banks use Mission learning to detect suspicious transactions and the finally healthare predicting disase based on medical data and that's Mission learning in a nutshell it helps Mission learn from data and make smart decs it is used in Industries like healthare finance and

machine learning let's discover how computers can learn from data machine learning is a revolutionary approach that allows computers to learn without explicit programming to understand machine learning let's compare it with traditional programming in traditional programming we provide rules and data to get answers but in machine learning we provide data and answers and the computer learns the rules one of the most common applications is pattern recognition let's see how a machine learning model can learn to distinguish between different shapes the computer learns by analyzing many examples finding patterns in the data as the model processes more data its accuracy improves over time the learning curve shows how the model's accuracy increases as it sees more training examples eventually reaching a high level of performance in supervised learning the computer learns from labeled examples each training example is labeled with its correct category like these colored blocks labeled red and blue when given a new block the model can predict its category based on what it learned from the training data unsupervised Learning Works differently the computer finds patterns in unlabeled data the algorithm discovers natural groupings in the data like these two distinct clusters reinforcement learning involves an agent learning through trial and error the agent starts at one point and must find its way to the goal learning from its successes and failures through many attempts the agent learns to find more efficient paths to reach its goal let's explore how a neural network processes information through its layers when data enters the network it flows through connections between neurons with each connection having a specific weight or strength the network learns by adjusting the strength of connections based on the error in its predictions as the network trains the error decreases from 0.5 through weight adjustments as the network trains the error decreases from 0.3 through weight adjustments as the network trains the error decreases from 0.1 through weight adjustments after training the network can make accurate predictions by processing new data through its optimized connections this process of forward propagation and weight adjustment continues until the network achieves satisfactory performance to train a machine learning model effectively we split our data into three parts the training data which makes up about 60% of our data set is used to teach the model validation data about 20% helps us check if the model is learning properly or just memorizing the remaining 20% is our testing data which we we use only at the end to evaluate the model's final performance during training the model processes the training data multiple times adjusting its internal parameters to improve accuracy as training progresses we track both training and validation accuracy when validation accuracy stops improving or starts decreasing we know it's time to stop training to prevent overfitting once training is complete we can use our model to make predictions on new handwritten numbers the model assigns a confidence score to each prediction indicating how sure it is about its answer let's explore how machine learning helps filter spam emails from your inbox the system analyzes various features of each email and assigns confidence scores to determine if it's spam or legitimate movie recommendation systems analyze viewing patterns and ratings from similar users by finding users with similar tastes the system can suggest new content you might enjoy virtual assistants use multiple machine learning models to understand and respond to your queries your request goes through several processing steps speech recognition natural language processing context analysis and response generation finally the system generates an appropriate response based on the processed information self-driving cars use machine learning to understand their environment in real time the system continuously detects and classifies objects like other vehicles pedestrians and road signs based on these detections the car plans a safe path and makes driving

then we'll start start with the session meanwhile uh I have joined hi yeah hi that much meanwhile you have joined uh um you can just message me uh you can just type in the chat from which college you are okay uh is it audible now clearly please uh confirm in the chat uh is my voice audible clearly no yeah I suppose uh you're all uh college graduates who completed btech or from other streams right yeah okay uh so the main uh my voice is not audible one second okay okay thank you for uh first year okay that's good starting the preparation very early so uh you are here to like to get to know about more about the data science uh and the subjects in there and also I'll try to explain it more in a more um simple way rather and uh throwing many slides at you um we'll just start with U the PDF my name is Rahul and uh I'm a teaching assistant um in Gig for giges I've been doing it from uh two months so um we were going to discuss about um data science and what you are going to learn in this particular course and what are the main things that are currently going in um today U like it sector uh regarding data science and uh yeah how is the Jo are you guys excited let's make it more interactive you can you can just uh type type it in the chat yeah and before starting yeah before starting may I uh just want to know like what are the what are your interest regarding data science U why you are U why you got the dream to like choose this particular um technology anyone I'm just curious hello I I'll talk loudly okay um ml that's good ml yeah machine learning any other deep learning okay and most useful in the future of human okay for humans in case of yeah okay okay um so how many of uh you guys are uh mostly interested uh towards data science or data analytics I just want uh to know do you know the difference between them anyone we'll start with uh introduction to um I'm asking about uh do you know what uh what do you mean by data science or uh like difference between data science and uh this data analytics I just want to type the answers so yeah keep it in the chat no okay okay so uh we'll start with uh we start with the presentation and after that I'll let you know what are the things that you have to focus on so um yeah basics of m i I'll discuss yeah we'll start with um data science first so data science is a like it's a field where you use um statistics uh statistical methods and machine learning uh statistical methods and also mathematical Concepts to improvise the algorithms or uh to improvise understanding of the raw data that you have and um to get insights as well so we U you can see this diagram right this one yeah see um you can see uh like machine uh we'll start we talk about the artificial intelligence first and uh then um we'll discuss others so artificial intelligence is just um um a machine that uh also that mimics the human behavior which further builds upon the machine learning which is the subset of a and because uh we'll use machine learning by taking some yeah okay we'll take uh machine learning Concepts like uh linear regression and uh regression clustering and uh Concepts to understand the basic data that we have uh like in the tables and then we'll try to mimic that Behavior Uh and automate it through artificial intelligence and deep learning is a concept uh where we use neural networks like um you can say that um okay one second so uh to make it simple um in order to learn data science uh we first have to go through a programming language that is mostly uh related to uh that is mostly related to uh improvising the concepts that you have learned through statistic uh so you can uh always go with um python or R um python is very good language because you'll have extensive libraries uh to uh like naai pandas and uh mat to visualize and also work on numerical operations much more easily than other than other things so the first part uh that you have to do is uh learn a learn a language either python or that would be uh very much useful and uh thereafter um the second thing that you have to do is to understand uh the statistical Concepts uh Advanced statistical Concepts uh then after you can directly start with machine learning if you want to go through uh data science you can start with the machine learning uh basic concepts like uh regression uh clustering or classification and uh then after you can you can try building uh some basic uh basic projects so um we'll also talk talk about uh gen which is uh very much uh useful in nowadays like U the great example would be chat GPT um whenever uh we are trying to uh deug or code any uh new idea which we have in our mind uh we'll just type it out in a simple language and that will give us uh very uh data using uh like very uh user generative input from uh that promps that we have entered and uh see this is uh you can see uh the screen here this is a um scanning of our um human body to understand the disease diagnosis so uh in this case you can use deep learning because deep learning is a concept like where uh we can give a particular images images to the neural network and it will it will just uh break it down into several segments or uh you can say uh what we call uh it will break it down into several parts and it will try to understand based on the data that we have given previously and uh it will also run the model uh many times to understand what uh particular image that we have given and thereafter it can predict whether that particular uh output that we have right now in the screen uh whether we have pneumonia disase or no pneumonia it will give an output to us um yeah it will classify uh the outputs thereafter you can uh it will decide whether uh we have a particular adds or not and uh Gemini Gemini yeah Gemini from Google it's also a GPT model so I think the um Gemini is much more uh reliable and also it will give the information that is particularly uh related to the um particularly which are in the websites that we just Google it and uh see there are some websites also uh like co-pilot and uh you can just you can just uh type a general prompt like anything uh someone walking on the road orse someone typing the code it will just uh give an uh AI image that we want and we can use it anywhere we want that uh that has uh also given us much more uh what we say broader perspective of using Ai and our real life currently so coming to um statistical ml so you can see uh I can make you understand u in a much more simple way you can see that here we have a table of two columns and uh we have the area and prices list and uh numerical uh like we have numerical data so with this data you can uh build a linear regression model regarding uh by drawing a simple graph x xaxis and y axis you can just plot it uh plot it into this area into xaxis and the price into y axis and you can just view it in a much more simple way using bar graph or any other things uh other visualization techniques precisely to understand uh the given data in a much more easier way possible so um here neural networks yeah after statistics uh if I talk about the neural networks as I said before it will just classify uh it will just take your input image you if you uh you say let's take an example you have 100 images of uh different CS it will take those 100 images as input and thereby break down each pixel of that particular cat uh you can say uh if you have one cat photo it will just break it down into 100 pixels for example those 100 pixels and for one picture it's 100 pixels and then after another 100 pictures are there of the cat there thereby it will bre break down into another 100 100 um pieces those all will be given as input to the neural network then uh we'll add some convolutional layer or uh any other uh like hidden layers in between hidden layers are nothing but just uh where the computation happens where uh the features of the cat like the eye the ears and or the mouth or the skin that will be uh identified and stor in the hidden layers so after uh mixing all these uh inputs at the end of the last layer which is output layer it will just classify uh whether the given image which we give after uh creating the model we'll give an image either cat or dog as we have trained the model uh to identify the cat if you give a cat image then it will identify and give the output as a cat but if you give a dog image then it will uh it may not identify as a dog but it will not give the output as a cat that's the difference there so neural networks are basically uh very uh complex to understand but if you take a simple example or a simple data set or simple uh like 10 images or 20 images then it would be much more uh like it will will be easier to understand and to also train the model you cannot start with a a big data set uh containing 10,000 images but as to understand you have to start uh with Basics see um and uh one more thing uh talking about um machine learning as many guys of you like many of you guys are asking so machine learning is just a type of artificial intelligence U which allows machines to um learn from the data that we have that let's say we have an input data and also make decisions without being uh programmed or intervened uh we don't have to uh always uh try to um check that uh whether we have got an output or not it will just take the data and uh also redirects the input uh to the starting of the layer and it will again uh change the inputs to get the desired output so uh in machine learning there are many Concepts involved like um mainly data and then algorithms and then uh predictions uh what we want to get get as an output and then there's an evaluation if you have any error in the that particular model you have to uh um understand that error uh before uh getting the output as well or before uh what we say completing the project uh and then after uh taking an algorithm and implementing it you'll uh you have to optimize that particular uh what we say uh um optimize a particular algorithm and also it just weights to improve it so uh these are all um let's forget about these Concepts uh this uh what we say um Concepts inside the ml we'll just talk about the basic stuff here so um as I said before uh we have to Learn Python and then uh statistic Concepts which is uh you can see here the statistical ML and then uh you have to do a project uh we'll do a project on ML machine learning using basic uh features or basic data set uh you can find it on uh any uh website as well like KAG and uh after that you can uh you can just deploy your model uh into some websites or you can directly added to the resume that would be much more uh like what we say helpful for your career as well see um I think everyone knows uh Google um like Google Translation how many of you know about Google Translation or how many of you used in real life so Google Translation works on um a concept in ml which is natural uh language processing uh which is NLP see uh I'll explain it in more simple way so if you have a sentence like I love eating pza so this uh NLP NLP is uh natural language processing which understands the meaning of the meaning of the words that we you have given for example uh as a noun verb or uh you can say you can you know parts of speech right so it will identify the parts of speech of the sentence and also understand uh whether that particular um word uh that particular sentence that you have chosen has ause positive meaning or negative meaning then uh it will justify or it will give you an output based on that so uh Google Translate is used in that way see uh you can see like uh there you have typed I love us and you get an output in the second second box yeah you can also listen to it uh this example and you can see the example here this is also based on natural language processing so uh okay boring okay uh just leave it aside leave the slides aside uh I'll explain it more simply what do you mean by data sent so um if you want to uh like just uh understand or uh want to pursue a career in data science just start with uh learning the things practically first um just start with uh python uh don't try to learn uh everything completely just try to uh learn learn as small as possible and try to implement it in a practical way suppose if You Learn Python just do a project on python so the road map that I um that I want to explain to you guys is if you if anyone of you guys are in first year or second year or um graduated uh and are interested in uh doing data science just start with uh Python programming language okay and uh thereafter you can start with Statistics basic statistics uh like mean Moree median or measure of central like those Concepts measure of central tendency and uh thereafter uh you can start with uh ml directly if you want to go to uh go towards the data sign start with ML and uh just learn about the basic algorithms linear regression logistic regression classification clustering K clustering so learn about these things and try to implement uh try to use jupter notebook and implement it uh Implement these Concepts through uh the knowledge that you have learned in a more practical way that would be very much helpful for you guys and uh thereafter uh you can uh dwell into deep learning if you're interested in identifying um images or uh if you are interested in working with uh image classification particularly so um deing is much more complex to be honest but if you are uh if you are um as long as you are implementing it uh by um what we say learning uh by taking a project or by taking a data set then you'll Master it but don't try to learn uh don't try to keep on learning the stuff try to implement it as as far as possible um that's my uh suggestion if you want to thrive in the data science field and uh thereafter uh if you want to uh work on um particular uh things like as I shown as a Google translate or things then you can uh try to use natural language processing you have many Concepts uh embedded into artificial intelligence and data science but uh it would be helpful to get a good knowledge good basic knowledge uh and practical knowledge as well on the concepts that we have see um can you uh can you guys see my screen guys uh can anyone confirm okay screen is not visible I share it again is it visible now anyone no I think the screen is visible okay okay got it see uh you can see here in the Python programming language you learn uh about the basics of python and then uh data structures like um list triup and uh sets and dictionaries and there after as I said we'll use several libraries like map. Li and cbone to uh yeah okay uh to visualize and also uh plot graphs and they uh and then you'll use pandas and nay for Eda particularly to uh load the data set and also work on numerical features and thereafter you'll learn about machine learning algorithms as I said basic statistics and statistics in ml and uh regression regression problems means regression is a like u a basic uh what you say algorithm in machine learning and uh there after you learn classification algorithms um and clustering as well uh I'll explain about uh clustering if uh in a more simple way to make you understand so uh if you have any three features or three color boards if you say blue red and and green so uh for example if you have dropped all those 100 walls of three different kinds in a particular uh um particular floor then uh clustering is a very good example that uh it will just uh um divides or uh it will just make uh those particular three groups into uh individual uh what we say I'll just show I'll just show you a picture that would be more interactive to make you understand yeah uh can you see this see see here screen is not visible [Music] uh yeah sorry guys for the inconvenience is my screen visible now okay leave that no issue I'll just move on with the topic um so you learn about machine learning algorithms some basic machine learning algorithms related to regression classification and clustering and uh thereafter you'll learn more about uh natural language processing which is another subject like machine learning and deep Lear learning which helps to uh identify and understand uh which basically uh um gives us uh the chance to work with uh not profit okay which basically gives us the chance to work with the text data and there are also sever conception NLP which is one h coding bag of words and TD factorer so these are the concepts that you will learn in NLP and as I said in deep learning you'll have artificial neural networks and uh forward propagation backward propagation this forward propagation and backward propagation are uh just to uh make your model much more effective and uh activation functions is uh activation functions or lost functions are uh particularly which I mentioned before about uh that when I'm explaining about the images of the cat where we have a hidden layer in between so in that hidden layer these activation functions are particularly used to um understand about uh or to solve about the complexity of uh complex um to solve the complex problems that uh we have uh in that particular model and uh we'll just skip this part okay and okay um so related to gen uh you'll uh just uh you learn more about um chat gbt and also how to use the prompts that you have um to get uh more from the platform okay so use uh we'll also learn more about uh generative like Char and [Music] gini to understand or to uh get much more uh effective Solutions or uh from our uh like for our particular inputs and you can use you can get the most out of it if you have any uh questions or doubts or if you have any ideas that will uh by entering uh some easy prompts you'll uh get a much more broader view of what you are uh currently um trying to do so yeah so after completing this ml projects um mlr deep learning projects you'll further uh you'll further into uh at the last step you have to deploy compulsory so for that you'll learn about AWS uh Amon web services and aure I think these uh the AWS andure are the must to deploy the machine learning models that we have created Rel related to data science and uh yeah yeah that's it uh that's it for the subject that uh we are trying uh we try to cover today so if you guys have any doubts uh regarding uh any of the any of the things that I have shared you can just uh ask me in the chat or else uh I can just uh I can just give you a summary of what uh I have told until now uh any of you are having any [Music] questions e I guess no one is having any questions to ask okay uh okay and uh so in gigs for gigs U we are currently U like focusing on um uh course particularly related to data science and data analytics uh so you have uh 3 months of uh if you take a course uh for example related to data science uh you have 3 months to complete it that is 90 days if you can complete that uh those modules or the questions or the assignments that they have given uh in the module um the Geeks for geeks website uh after you purchase this course if you can complete all the uh modules and all the assignments that uh they have given in the uh given time which is 90 days before uh 90 days you'll uh get a 90% refund refund of that uh entire course fees that you have paid only if you uh completed before 90 days so that's a good challenge actually uh for anyone who is interested and who is trying to uh um take a challenge or uh who who are trying to learn about her data science I think uh we have amazing uh what we say an amazing uh modules to uh get to know about uh data science Concepts and even U some good questions to understand about the algorithms of machine learning and deep learning so on every course uh not only one course or not only on data science or data analytics on every course that we are uh currently having uh you'll get a 90% refund if you complete the course only in uh on before 90 days you can use the copon here which I have mentioned and yeah that's it guys uh if you guys have have any doubts I'll be here for another five minutes uh you can ask and uh give you a proper guidance regarding that and uh thank you guys for everyone for joining

PROGRAMMING",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HafzawNlUo",duration:1224,transcript:"[Music] hello friends welcome back to our channel so in the previous session we have seen the Java buzzwords so that we call it as a features in this session let us have a look on the whoops concepts so what are the hopes concepts object gas affection and cancellation inheritance polymorphism so this we call as oops concepts now let us see one by one first what is meant by object so an object is defined as a real-world entity so whatever the thing we are seeing in the real world that can be treated as an object so this object is a real good entity and this object consists of so properties and the tasks performed by us perform by this object so whatever the real world entity which is having these properties in the past some tasks to be performed those we call as an object let us take an example human human being is also an entity and it's an also an object so human consists of properties like name the color height and etc so these are the properties so what is lumen can do task one of the past can be done by this would be one the right exactly so these are the tasks can be performed by this human so we can consider this human as it object hope you understood so object is a real world entity which is having the properties and some tasks that get that it can be performed right no what about the class s is a group that objects object follows the object follows so it is a blueprint that an object follows so without the class object is not there so this class consists of L number of objects number of objects consists of number of objects and the object can be defined as instance of a class instance of a class so the base object will follow the prototype defined by this class example let us take a student student in a class student in a classroom so what are the properties so properties all variables you can say them as so properties of the student 1 screen name to get Holdenville and student date of drawing they'd of joy right so this is a gas and all the objects which are defined by this gas should follow this prototype so that for example a student in a class there are n number of students every student can be considered as an object which follows the same for prepare and one of the hostage to be performed by the student read write play right so every student can have three properties rail right in play every student will be having the three company's name roll number and some date of joy so whatever the objects created through this class will follow the same structure but face objects so student consists of a number of objects so student class comes yourself some ABC the name of a student here we see some deal some change so ABC will be having name whole number date of joining name whole temple gate of joy similarly GHI so here the abcdefgh a of the mains name of a student let it be like something sandy and some fish roe remember and they don't work and for every student will follow some properties some rain write and play so these three properties can be done I mean invoked by this legacy and this properties can be applied for BEF and this properties can be done by GHI so I am object is an instance of a class and a class is a blueprint that the object shoof all right so I can consists of n number of objects many number of objects hope you ever saw this object in class because our channel programming completely deals with these two things tasin object for everything we will create a chasm we will create an object so a casts cannot crisis the methods of another gas directly so one can methods cannot be invoked by the another another gas so in order to access the methods of another class one can should create its own object so simply we can say a classes cannot communicate with each other but in order to communicate with each other objects should be read so for every communication objects should be created so if Cassie and Kashmir wants to communicate so here the communication means invoking the methods of one class by another gas so every class is having the methods right so tasks so invoking those methods or tasks from one class to another class is called a communication and this cannot be done between two classes and this can be done only between objects so in order to communicate two classes first the instances should be generated and through those instances though the two classes will be communicated so hope you understood this thing the castle object next abstraction a fraction means showing only essential parts only essential parts and hiding the implementation details this is called abstraction this can be achieved in this Java programming just the best example so if you download an Android application from the Play Store so we mitigated dot the apk file right not apk file or you can download a software so that we can get gone exe file and if you run this exe file we can get the software and we can use the software but here we can't see the packages or our methods or a functions which are used to create this exe file that means all the implementation part is hide you and only the essential part is visible right so this is the best example so similarly if you download an application from Android Play Store you will hear a dot etheta file but you will not get the method sort of packages or any functions which I have written to generate this dot apk file so all the implementation details will be hidden right so this type of applications can be done in Java programming that we call it as an abstraction or a data hiding I hope you understood this abstraction next one so object class instruction now and capsulation encapsulation so this means binding variables and the methods under single entity binding the variables and methods under single entity so see for it understanding will write here so class is having three parts what is the name of a class so this is a case here we will write the variables and here we will write the methods similarly object is also having the name variables and methods sim simply we can say student is a class having the variables name whole number and a date of joining and the methods read/write okay thanks so this is a cache so here we are writing the variables and these are all variables and this we call as methods right these are core variables these are core methods so here we are binding these variables and methods in a single entity we call it as class or object so object is also having the same structure that means one class will be having in whole number character name and similarly the real method right method so one cast consists of variables and the methods right so this is called encapsulation so hope you understood this one next travel to the next concept in radians inheritance so what is between Higgins acquiring the properties of one class to another class acquiring the properties of one class to another class simply with let's say it does parent class and it changes so chain casts will acquire the properties of parent class right changes will be having acquiring the properties of painting class so this week on it has this class or we can call it this change has will be called as day right so an herbal class is a class which is there are from the base class there are yes or you can call this parent as superclass and this change classes sometimes right so acquiring the properties of one cast to another dress so here acquiring the properties of parent class to the changes so this this concept we call it as inheritance so here there are different types of inheritance right so we will have a single inheritance multi-level in evidence hi lyrical ingredients so let us see the basic interaction then we will move on by one by one right so we will see one by one concept in the depth now in this session let us cover the interaction of all these object-oriented concepts so we can have these three types of in hidden single multi-level and character so this is called inheritance concept next coming to the polymorphism so performing the same tasks same task in different ways in different ways that is called as a polymorphism here tasks means a method method so in working the metal in different ways for example if we are having a program or addict of two numbers we can write and simply we can call ahead without any parameters we can call ad with into a comma in to be right so two methods so both will perform the same task but implementation is different here we are not passing any arguments and here we are passing only I mean two arguments right then this type of implementation we call it as a polymer let it be one more example I will explain so I am having the method called drop polygon drop polygon so this drop one hand can be anyone so we can draw circle as I say it's a polygon so we can draw square we can draw rectangle we can draw a triangle right so both all the three are the polygons all the three are polygons so here just I am implementing properly done and that drop polygon can be square rectangular finding that means implementing this task in different ways this is called polymorphism so this can be achieved in Java by eg by every building method overloading method right and method overriding so the conversations we'll see what what is meant by this method overloading and methylome right so with this we can implement thump I thanked by polymorphism and with this one-time polymerase so we can achieve the compiled them our polymorphism by implementing method overloading and we can achieve this runtime polymorphism by implementing method overriding okay so we will see one by one in the further sessions hope you understood the basic concept of this polymorphism right so these are the concepts of object-oriented programming so object casts abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism so if you are having any doubts regarding this oops concepts feel free to post your thoughts in the comment section so that I will definitely try to clarify all your doubts and if you really understood my sessions share my sessions with your friends and like my sessions and don't forget to subscribe to our Channel thanks for listening thank you very much"},{video_id:"pTB0EiLXUC8",title:"Object-Oriented Programming, Simplified",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8",duration:454,transcript:"[Music] a popular interview question concerns the four core concepts in object-oriented programming this concepts are encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism let's look at each of these concepts before object-oriented programming we had procedure of programming that divided a program into a set of functions so we have data stored in a bunch of variables and functions that operate on the data this style of programming is very simple and straightforward often it's what you learn as part of your first programming subject at a university but as your programs grow it will end up with a bunch of functions that are all over the place you might find yourself copying and pasting lines of code over and over you make a change to one function and then several other functions break that's what we call spaghetti code there is so much interdependence e between all these functions it becomes problematic object-oriented programming came to solve this problem in object-oriented programming we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit we call that unit an object we refer to these variables as properties and the functions as methods here's an example think of a car a car is an object with properties such as make model and color and methods like start stop and move now you might say what marche we don't have cars in our programs give me a real programming example ok think of the local storage object in your browser's every browser has a local storage object that allows you to store data locally this local storage object has a property like length which returns the number of objects in the storage and metals like set item and remove item so in object-oriented programming we group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects and this is what we call encapsulation let me show you an example of this in action so here we have three variables base salary over time and rate below these we have a function to calculate the wage for an employee we refer to this kind of implementation as procedural so we have variables on one side and functions on the other side they're hard decoupled now let's take a look at the object-oriented way to solve this problem we can have an employee object with three properties a salary over time and rate and a method called get wage now why is this better well first of all look at the get wage function this function has no parameters in contrast in a procedural example our get wage function has three parameters the reason in this implementation we don't have any parameters is because all these parameters are actually modeled as properties of this object all these properties and the get wage function they are highly related so they are part of one unit so one of the symptoms of procedural code is functions with so many parameters when you write code in an object-oriented way your functions end up having fewer and fewer parameters as Uncle Bob says the best functions are those with no parameters the fewer the number of parameters the easier it is to use and maintain that function so that's encapsulation now let's look at abstraction think of a DVD player as an object this DVD player has a complex logic board on the inside and a few buttons on the outside that you interact with you simply press the play button and you don't care what happens on the inside all that complexity is hidden from you this is abstraction in practice we can use the same technique in our objects so we can hide some of the properties and methods from the outside and this gives us a couple of benefits first is that we'll make the interface of those objects simpler using an understanding an object with a few properties and methods is easier than an object with several properties and methods the second benefit is that it helps us reduce the impact of change let's imagine that tomorrow we change these inner or private methods these changes will leak to the outside because we don't have any code that touches these methods outside of their containing object we may delete a method or change its parameters but none of these changes will impact the rest of the applications code so with abstraction we reduce the impact of change now the third core concept in object-oriented programming inheritance inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code here's an example think of HTML elements like text boxes drop-down lists checkboxes and so on all these elements have a few things in common they should have properties like hidden and inner HTML and metals like click and focus instead of redefining all these properties and methods for every type of HTML element we can define them once in a generic object call it HTML element and have other objects inherit these properties and methods so inheritance helps us eliminate redundant code and finally polymorphism poly means many more means form so polymorphism means many forms in object-oriented programming polymorphism is a technique that allows you to get rid of long ethanol's or switch and case statements so back to our HTML elements example all these objects should have the ability to be rendered on a page but the way each element is rendered is different from the others if you want to render multiple HTML elements in a procedural way our code would probably look like this but with object orientation we can implement a render method in each of these objects and the render method will behave differently depending on the type of the object you're referencing so we can get rid of this nasty switch and case and use one line of code like this you will see that later in the course so here are the benefits of object oriented programming using encapsulation we group related variables and functions together and this way we can reduce complexity now we can reuse this object and do from parts of a program or in different programs with abstraction we hide the details and the complexity and show only the essentials this technique reduces complexity and also isolates the impact of changes in the code with inheritance we can eliminate redundant code and with polymorphism we can refactor ugly switch case statements well hello it's me mash again I wanted to say thank you very much for watching this tutorial to the end I hope you learned a lot please share and like this video to support me if you want to learn more about the object-oriented programming as I told you before I

Tutorials for Beginners",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dhec_2zGUk",duration:1770,transcript:"so in the series of learning object-oriented programming in c plus plus in the previous video we have discussed what is object-oriented programming and how it is different from processor oriented programming the difference we have seen the basics about object-oriented programming like now in this video we'll see oops concept right before we deep down into the object-oriented programming in c plus plus you must have some idea about the concepts the no the things because of those things we call it as object-oriented programming what are those concepts like class objects abstraction encapsulation inheritance polymorphism six concepts are there so in this video i am going to talk about these concepts briefly i just want you to get familiar with these concepts in detail we will discuss about these concepts one by one in later videos once we will move you know deep down into c plus plus course right but at first you must be familiar about these concepts like what are these concept at least the basic idea you should have right so those things will discuss in this video every concept in brief i'll relate it with the real life example i hope you will get it right but before that i just want to tell you one thing with theory practice is also important the key to success in any interview specifically in programming interview coding interview is practice practice as much as possible it's not like that start practicing coding problems just you know few days before your interview no the best method of preparation is incorporating your interview preparation into your everyday coding practice it will help to improve your logic building skills your thinking capability your problem solving skills and that's exactly the industry wants a problem solver but the question is how to get started from where you can practice the problems coding problems so here is the solution this is the practice page of geeks for geeks here you will get many coding questions different different topics like from dsa array linked list stack in algorithm you will get different coding questions on the topic searching sorting and many algorithm based on many algorithm as well as company specific coding questions practice questions you also get suppose if you want to practice the problems which are being asked in amazon interview then just click on that and you can you will find out the list of problems and you can start solving these problems and it is not good for students only but as well as for working professional if you are working somewhere and you want to switch you are applying for new position then also it will help you practicing these problems will definitely help you so i think this is a great resource to practice these coding problems don't worry the link i'll put in the description box of this video you can go and check out now let's back to the topic so what are hoops concepts six concepts are there basically these are six concepts in object oriented program see as the name suggests object oriented so obviously object is the main thing everything revolve about the around the object so you'll see these concept and these four are known as you can say pillars pillars of object oriented programming but we will discuss these six things all these six concepts so let me just take one example see let's take one example like student maybe you will you know related better student so simply student in student in your class you have male as well as female student right now every student is having some common properties like two hands two legs two eyes nose height weight color these are some common properties they have right and some functions like sleep can eat can study or speak and sit here these are some common functions right every student is having either male or female so we can consider it like a student is a class which is what it is like you can say a user defined data type in technical terms if you say then it is a user definer type as in c we have structures user defined data types which is having some data members and member functions now what are those data members the attributes the properties they have like student is a class and having like you can say legs and hands some body parts you can say then you can say height weight and color right these are some properties or you can say attributes or you can say data or you can say data members so whatever the data that would be considered as in the form of that would be stored in the form of variables in the class next functions what we can have like eat sleep and sit speak and many more so these are some common functions right so class is basically what a blueprint of an entity which defines the core properties and functions of that entity now entity means one entity is male and female you know students actual students are entities like student name can be ram you can say jenny rahul nisha these are some students so male students female students right so these are and you can say real world entities and these are known as known as objects okay in my class i have a student like rahul rahul is an object right of class male class right two more classes are there you can say like male and female here we have male class and female so object is what a real world entity rahul physical existence rahul is having physical existence class is just a logical thing it's just a definition it's just a blueprint so no memory allocation would be done when you define a class no memory allocation because it is just a logical thing it's not physical object is physical thing now we can access these properties and functions of a class using objects of these class or you can say instance of the this class right rahul is what you can say an object of male class so whatever is there in male the attribute and the functions rahul can access using rahul we can access those properties and those functions so rahul is physical thing rahul is having some space right in this environment here in the class right so same when you create an object then only memory allocation would be done in the if i you know say in the form of programming so class is what it is just a blueprint or a prototype through which we can create objects or you can say it is you can say group of objects which share common properties right common properties in common you can say attributes these are attributes this is you can say behavior or methods behavior or methods or functions we can say don't worry i have notes also i'll provide you notes everything i have written in my notes handwritten notes right you just have to understand now right what is class and what is object now see object also i hope you got it right it's a physical thing or it's a real world entity right which is having some behavior or some properties of its own behavior and properties fine that is object so like suppose i have an object one object is ram you can say nisha and pile these are some objects right so objects were just an instance of a class rahul and these are instances of male class initial pile these are instances of female class so they they are having their own data and functions or you can say the code right each object is having its own data and the functions the functions which can manipulate that data each function has its own function and data like ram is having its own you can say height weight color right and on function is there ram is having its own functions rahul is also having different height color and weight every object is having its own you can say code and uh data using code or the functions we can manipulate that data fine and each object can interact with each other with the help of message passing and for interacting they don't need to have the internal knowledge of their data and code suppose if i want to rahul want to communicate with ram so it's not like that rahul has to know the internal everything about ram right what rahul need to know in which form the message would be accepted or you can say the language rahul understand hindi or english that's it and in which language rahul will respond that's it so same in programming one object can interact with other object without knowing the internal detail the code or the ah no the data of that object what just need to know the type of message would be accepted by other object and what type of output the what type of response that object will give right so that the objects can also communicate with each other using message passing so class is just a logical thing it suggests a blueprint a blueprint to create objects and objects are physical thing identify you know you can identify that entity real world entity which is having its own you can say properties and behavior right now first thing we'll discuss inheritance because through this diagram you can get it better see male and female these students are also having like these properties and these functions and female will also have female in a student will also have these properties and functions and these properties and function we have already defined in a class student so rather than defining these things rather than defining these functions and everything here also here also we will do what we just reuse this thing and how you can reuse this is one of the most important characteristics so you can say pillar of oop oop oops you can inherit these properties through inheritance so they will inherit these properties here also and here also so whatever is there these functions you can say these functions and the attributes attributes means the variables and the functions right here also and here also and male and female each class can have their extra their own attributes like some body parts in female are having which male are not having so they can have their own data their own function right male can also have their own function and data and thus common properties they can inherit from this class from this class rather than rewriting again and again so this is what beauty of inheritance these are known as child class and or you can say derived class and this is known as base class or parent class right so code reusability is there so that is why rather than writing same code again and again productivity would increase we can reuse some other code and we can just do whatever we want to do one more thing in object i want to tell in technical terms we say objects are having its own data and code through which we can manipulate the data like ram is having its own data and code means the functions this code right whatever we write here so if ram suppose i can say if ram will eat more then weight would increase so through these functions we can modify these data of that object it's not like that if rahul will eat more then weight of ram would increase no because these details are specific to these objects if jenny will eat more weight of jenny will increase not the weight of nisha or pile right so this data and code are binded together in the these objects using that code we can manipulate the data of that object only right i hope you got class objects and inheritance now we will see what is abstraction see let's take one example first suppose there is a coffee machine what is there one button is there make coffee you just press this button and your coffee is ready right if a machine second machine is something like that there we have a button like add some cold water to the pan boil the water second button is boil the water third button is add one cup of coffee there add sugar this something like this we have many buttons the complete process we have right so which one is better just the first machine having one button make coffee you just press this button and coffee is ready you don't need to go into the detail the implementation part means the making part of that coffee right so means in first machine we are just hiding the detail the process of making a coffee from the user that is what abstraction hiding implementation detail from the other world only showcase the relevant details which are relevant to the world which are relevant to the other users only showcase those details hiding the implementation detail that is just abstraction like when you switch on your fan you don't know what is happening behind there you just switch on you just press that button and your ac is on your fan is on your tv zone like your dvd player once you switch on your you know you can say the tv and the dvd player or that you can say what is that setup box then on the screen the whole world is in your room you can see everything right but behind the scene what is happening how you are getting that data on your tv on your you know set of works through satellite or what is happening you don't know right so that is what abstraction same hiding something into a function or in java we can uh you can we can achieve this abstraction with the help of interfaces and abstract classes 100 in abstraction we can achieve in java right so hiding something into a function or you know an interface these kind of things that is called as abstraction because when you call a function sometimes you don't need to go into the detail of that function that how that process is doing you just need an output you call that function and you need the output that's it because see there are in large scale application there is a large code base if you go in the detail of each and every function then it would take you even months to read out all the functions and you would never code right so rather than going into the implementation detail just showcase the relevant details only that is simple abstraction like in this you can take some other classes their animal or you can say alien i hope spelling is correct maybe animals or aliens know that like student or male 1 female can walk can uh you know eat can do these kind of things but how they don't know the implementation detail so that is simply obstruction in programming also we can achieve obstruction but how we will discuss later just i you know i just want to get you familiar with these terms basic terms next is encapsulation as the name suggests in capsule capsule means means you have seen a capsule medicine the tablet there we have a wrapper in which we have some medicine right there is a wrapper around that that thing right so that is what we are hiding the inner thing we are hiding from the inner whatever is there in the capsule we are hiding that thing by putting the wrapper from outside the world right like around the chocolate we have a wrapper so that chocolate is hidden from the outside world with the help of that wrapper right so sometimes encapsulation is also known as referred as data hiding right so wrapping up of these things data and the functions into a single unit that is known as encapsulation or you can say like something like this you can take this example binding this this you know data and the code together in one unit is known as encapsulation so simply what encapsulation we can say like here in a class this is a class in class we have we have data or attributes you can say right and we have methods or functions or behavior so binding these data and these methods or the functions together this is known as encapsulation in c plus plus that's it this is encapsulation right now you can hide this data from the outside world because we have a uh in a concept we have something in c plus but that is x specified means you just keep the data private public private protected three specifiers so you just keep the data private right and this suppose this object is having ram this is the data forum and these are methods these are the methods right for rahul also this is the data and these are methods so you can keep that data private only these functions these are public methods so only these functions these methods can can what access this data this object another object cannot access this data or another class cannot access that data let's take uh one example like uh we have in college we have multiple departments csc mechanical civil ec right suppose i am faculty in computer science department and i need one information i need some data from mechanical department right so it's not like that i can directly access the data from mechanical department right i will first talk to i will reach out to a person in mechanical department right and i i would request to that person to get me that data and after that through that person i can access the data right directly i cannot access exist so the data of mechanical department the employees or the faculties of mechanical department completely they are a single unit known as mechanical department so they are wrapped up they are in camps encamps encapsuled so the data is private to mechanical department only the faculties or employees of that department can access that data so this will increase the privacy the security of the data that is why in the previous video i have told you the main reason we have switched from pop to oop is data security and through encapsulation we can achieve that thing data security privacy by keeping the data private because we have access specifier concept here just keep all your data private and only these methods only the methods of that class access that data only right no other class can access that data if another class want to access that data they will communicate through these functions right and through these functions they can access that private data right we have some concept of friend function friend class but that also will discuss later will not go in this much detail i hope you know the basic idea of encapsulation right so it is you can say just a shield uh which prevents your data from being accessed by the code outside of that shield right or you can say the data or the variable this is the data or you can say the variables of one class can be accessed by the methods of its own class not by the other class right like other classes alien so they cannot access this data this data of human being class or a student class and how to achieve this encapsulation just keep your data private use a specifier private and keep your methods public and using these methods you can manipulate this data only these methods these functions of that class only can access this data private data this is how you can achieve encapsulation that's it now next is polymorphism see this poly means many and move means forms many forms polymorphism now how this would be related let's take a real life example here see me jenny is one person right but i have multiple forms or you can say many behaviors or many characteristics i can i have like i am i'm a faculty right i am a suppose a class teacher a tutor of any class uh or a friend or a colleague so with according to the situation i will change my behavior jenny is one only one person only but having multiple forms as a faculty like if i'm interacting with hod my behavior would be another means different if i'm in class as a class teacher or a tutor then my behavior would be different with a friend my behavior would be different with my colleagues suppose not friend but just a colleague my behavior would be different right so i can have multiple forms but person is one so this is what polymorphism right now how you can relate this in programming in programming we can have two types of polymorphism or we can achieve polymorphism uh by two types overloading and overriding see what overloading means let us take this example we have a function let me just rub this first suppose we have a function sum suppose we have this function sum one function is this i haven't written properly right some data would be there semicolon and all we have but it just just to get you familiar with this thing this function is having two argument integer this function is one end one float two float this is having three arguments right so this is what overloading of the function the function name is same but it will do sum of two integer it will do some of one in one float it will do some of two float number it will do some of three integer numbers this is what overloading just function name would be same maybe you can change the number of parameter the type of parameter the return type of that function according to that that function will behave differently so this is what overloading of the function sum so this is overloading function is same but having multiple forms one is overriding overriding means what actually overriding allows a child class to override a function which is already defined in its parent class right like let us take this example this is overloading and in overriding function name function would be same function name number of argument type of argument the return type of the function everything would be same just we change this code the implementation thing the mechanism suppose in parent class sum is equal to f x plus y this we have done sum is a variable or you can say another variable is one s x plus y maybe a child class will inherit this thing from the parent class but totally change the implementation and it will do some is equal to x minus y also it it's not correct but i just want to you know differentiate the overloading and overriding with the same example right so i have just everything is same name number of argument type of argument the return type everything is same but we have changed the implementation detail the child class has implemented that function specifically according to its need so this is what overriding of that function right let us take that example real life example ah suppose here we are we were having a function uh what walk right and male and female will inherit this function work right so male and female according to their self they can modify this like walk with legs argument will pass legs but in student class in parent class it is what normal walking like this we can walk right fine it's normal walking and they override this function walk with legs the same thing but they change this part this implementation part suppose female class they they'll change this part walk reverse something like this so they have changed the mechanism of walking although the name is same argument is same they are working with legs but they have changed the mechanism so that is overriding right and overloading means what simple if you take this example walk with legs right but another thing we have changed the argument like walk with the hands we haven't changed this mechanism this is just walk normal walking something like this but we have changed like the argument if here we are passing legs we have changed hands two hands we are working something like this so i hope you can relate this example also or if you are not able to relate you can take the previous example that some function and all right so the through these concepts we can achieve uh polymorphism like operator overloading is there function overloading is their function overriding is there in detail we will see these things in the later videos and this is known as if you achieve polymorphism using overloading that is known as compile time polymorphism this is known as runtime polymorphism so in detail we will discuss about these concepts one by one i hope the basic idea about these concepts are clear to you the four pillars of uh this object-oriented programming as well as the you can say six concepts of oops right if you have any doubt you can tell me in comment box maybe in the next video we can revise that concept or we i can take another example i can discuss that thing right so that's it for this video and the next video will see introduction to c plus plus so now i'll see the next video till then bye take care"},{video_id:"URZYJlO3tbE",title:"Object Oriented vs. Procedural Programming Paradigm",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URZYJlO3tbE",duration:220,transcript:`In this lesson, we will explore what are programming
paradigms and henceforth differentiate between Object-oriented programming and Procedural
programming. So let's start with exploring what are programming
paradigms. Well, programming paradigms are a way to classify
programming languages based on their features. And there are a lot of paradigms that exist
in the world of programming. Two of the most common programming paradigms
are: 1 - Object-Oriented Programming 2 - Procedural Programming So let us explore the differences
between them. On the left, we have object-oriented programming
paradigm. For simplicity, I will call it as OOP paradigm
and on the right, we have procedural programming paradigm. In the case of OOP paradigm, the program is
divided into small parts known as objects. But on the right, the program is divided into
small parts called functions. And this is one of the significant difference
between these two paradigms. Just because OOP paradigm supports inheritance,
we can reuse the code to the maximum extent. But on the other hand, since we don’t have
objects and classes, support for inheritance is absent. So there is limited code reusability. Features like Function overloading is supported
in OOP paradigm. But on the other side, it is not supported. In the OOP paradigm, access specifiers are
supported. While on the other hand they are not supported
in procedural programming. Due to that, OOP paradigm is more secure. Because we can use access specifiers to decide
which data should be hidden and which data should be exposed to the outside world. But in procedural paradigm, due to the lack
of access specifiers, data is less secured. There is no proper way to hide data. This makes data to be treated on top priority
in OOP paradigm. So data becomes more important than functions. But in procedural programming, since we don’t
have access specifiers and no proper data hiding mechanism, so we are only left with
dealing with functions. So by default, all data becomes public and
we need to manage only functions to achieve our objective. Which is quite a limitation. Isn't it? And the languages such as C++, Java, Python,
C# falls under the OOP paradigm. And languages such as C++, FORTRAN, Pascal,
C, basic comes under procedural paradigm. So here, you can note that C++ supports both
OOP paradigm as well as Procedural Paradigm. That’s why C++ is often referred to as a
Hybrid language. This might confuse you right now, looking
at the differences between these two paradigms. So for more clarity in the next lesson, we
will explore in detail the difference between C and C++ language. See you there.`},{video_id:"OEfSFrk_KEI",title:"14. The difference between procedural and object-oriented programming",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEfSFrk_KEI",duration:267,transcript:`In this next set of videos, we're going to
walk through various ideas around object-oriented programming and how to technically implement
a number of different techniques that are used within Drupal and also used across the
board on many object-oriented based projects. So at its core, object-oriented programming
will give you a better model of how to organize your code. Now, a lot of PHP programmers started
by simply hacking away and trying to get something that's functional and what you end up with
is something called procedural code. You have variables and you have functions, and the
role of the functions is to get from point A to point B. It's to complete some kind of
task. So for example, we might convert data from
one format to another or we might take some data in an array and organize it according
to its alphabetical order. And the idea is that you're constructing your code so that
you step through these different procedures. Now, after you have some programming experience,
you start to realize that a lot of these functions can be generalized so you can use them in
various other situations. So for example, if you have that function that sorts items
in an array alphabetically, you might find that useful to convert other types of data
into an alphabetically ordered list. For example, some XML Or a set of strings. And as you start to think this way, your mind
is actually going more towards object-oriented programming. You're thinking about these functions
as these little machines that can be used in different situations, not just the original
situation that they were intended for. When you start to dive into tutorials about
object-oriented programming, you'll find that people use real world objects as examples
because, in a big way, the world is very object-oriented. The idea is that as you look around you, you
see yourself surrounded by these different objects, and objects are basically anything
that you can give a noun to. So for example, right now I'm surrounded by
my computer, a glass of water, and a lamp. Because we can name each one of these things,
they are really objects. And in the real world, objects aren't limited in the way that they
can interact with one another. So for example, I can use the lamp to illuminate the keyboard
on my computer. I can use it to see through the glass of water that I have. I can take
the glass of water and dump it on the computer. And really, it keeps going but the idea is
that the interaction between the objects in our world are limited more by our imagination
rather than any limitation in the object itself. Now, if you apply that idea to your code,
then what you should end up with are these components that can be used in ways that were
unanticipated at the start because you have modeled the behavior of that item and contained
it in an object. And it turns out that this is actually a pretty natural way for code
to be organized. Now, the tricky part at first is taking that
idea and seeing how it relates to code. Because most of the time when we're dealing with code,
we're dealing with kind of abstract concepts, we're dealing with things that don't have
a parallel in the physical world. For example, on a website, we have images,
we have forms, we have blocks of content across the page, and templates. We can call each
of these things by their name which is a noun and that indicates, at least on some level,
that they're objects. In addition, there are objects that have more abstract ideas associated
with them. For example, a calculator that performs some operation on the data that gets
sent to it or, in the example of our function that sorts alphabetically, we have a sorter. Those little bits of code are like machines
and they're our inventions and we can give them whatever name we want, but they are objects
that didn't really exist before we created them. Now, if you don't immediately see the
application of this different way of looking at your code, that is, looking at it as objects
rather than a set of procedures, that's okay. That sort of perspective comes from actually
working with it and seeing how the code is organized and what kind of benefits arise
from organizing it in that different way. So just let some of those ideas start to percolate
and we're going to start getting our hands dirty. And along the way, we'll talk about
the implications of thinking of your code along these lines.`},{video_id:"jC0k-4Si0dM",title:"Difference Between Procedural Oriented and Object Oriented Programming | POP vs OOP [Hindi]",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC0k-4Si0dM",duration:1195,transcript:"Yes, today we are going to talk about the topic, not only the contribution of the interview but also from the point table of a language, this is the most important topic that is the difference between procedure, procedure oriented language, object oriented language and object based programming language. So the simple meaning of language is this. The language in which a complete program is divided into multiple functions is divided into multiple functions where one has a function and the date has functions internally divided into multiple small small modal multiple functions and I just want to say that today if any language has to exist in the market then it is Mast B Object Oriented Programming Language class hai hai any name supose tere is n class and this class consist some function so I will always go to you from the bottom and on date this is called bottom up approach Hello friends welcome a Once again your data player, in this free course of C Plus Plus Programming, where today we are going to talk about the topic, not only from the point of view of interview, but also the points of a language, this is the most important topic, difference between procedure, procedure oriented. Language Object Oriented Language and Object Based Programming Language What is Procedure Oriented Language? What is Object Oriented Language and Object Based Programming Language and where does C++ stand among these three because we are talking about C Plus Plus, it is okay. So let's talk here one by one, what is the difference between procedure oriented, object oriented and object based programming language? Procedure oriented language is the concept where your total program is divided into multiple functions, function tomorrow and your complete programs this. If we take the mother of divided into multiple functions, let us talk that this is my function in one and the functions in date are divided into small modals and these small models are basically kal functions function one function tu ok hai function 3 so whenever we use procedure oriented language So here you will always see [Music] The whole program is divided into small functions and that is why procedure oriented language is also called function oriented language, so the simple meaning of procedure oriented language is this language in complete program. Divided into multiple functions where one is a function and one is a function Internal divided into multiple small models Multiple small functions One D Most Important Factor About This Language Whenever we talk about Procedure Oriented Language then it follows D Top Dr Approach It follows Top Dr approach is ok Procedure Origin Language Always follows D Top Dr approach It's N Par Example Ok Now we have read C is big I don't know Ok Have you read or not but a small example Look, when we do programming in C, what is actually our programming thought, first of all we have to write in and inside this mother, if we call any function tomorrow, suppose After is defined right here you see what is the program Maa is n in function and give after bill tomorrow Approach is always program from top to top Dr and comes violin when we talk about object oriented so it is a bottom of approach which now we come to what is object oriented so procedure oriented language is a language which is finely divided into multiple models and these models are basically called functions and subroutines and procedures but meli you can change it country it n function and date on d region's procedure oriented programming language we are also called function oriented program language ok and procedure oriented as many languages You will see dat jo follow d top dr approach ye in d top you have a main function and give after jo d function [Music] kal hoga to ye top to bottom ki aur hoga it is always be from top to bottom approach so tha reason this The language is called top dr language or top dr approach language which is procedure oriented language so there is my language like C Pascal [Music] Procedure Oriented Programming Language there is no object oriented concept in this language C Pascal ok this is the language like this Language is basically called procedure oriented programming language COBOL is a very old language COBOL is ok, so here is the story, we do not talk about object oriented thought, this is completely a function oriented programming language, right here but now the thing is that sir, procedure oriented language is what we need. An object oriented programming language, so brother we will come to it now but first let us talk about what is an object oriented programming language and what is the difference between object oriented and object based programming language and where c++ stands for everyone plus plus here. Where is Right standing? So now listen to it very carefully because it is a very important concept, although right now I am not telling you the features of Object Oriented. Right now we are only discussing about the difference between these languages. Okay, Object Oriented Programming Language . This means that the language in which the program is completely divided into multiple objects classes is exactly where the program is divided into classes and is divided into objects and you can follow the features of object oriented programming. A language which follows the features of object oriented programming. This is called an object oriented programming language where the thought process which is done in programming is completely in the format of object computer class. I know it is quite difficult to understand what is class what is object if you are following the sequence. So you understand, right now we have neither talked about class nor have we talked about object, but don't worry, first you try to understand a little concept, after that I will explain to you, what is class, what is object, right, object. What does oriented programming mean? A language that follows certain features. A language that reduces to object oriented thought. A language where the program is divided into multiple classes and objects. Where bill talk about date is. There are multiple classes. Okay, this class is this. This n class one like we just talked about that procedure oriented language is divided into multiple function whereas object oriented programming language is divided into multiple classes c this one and every way ever bin okay so every d program it is divided into multiple classes where object oriented We will write the code from the thought class. What is an object oriented programming language and like I told you that object oriented programming means a language, you should follow the features of object oriented programming. Now what are these features about which we are talking now. I am just listing out these features here, we will talk about them in detail when we are going to discuss what is object oriented programming which our upcoming lecturers will write but which are the features of object oriented programming series one features like polymorphism Okay [Music] Features of Object Oriented Programming Right D Features Like [Music] Class Object Inheritance Class Object Features of Object Oriented Programming So whenever we are programming in any object oriented programming language, we want that this language supports this. Features are ok, which you will get in C Plus Plus, which you will get in Java, which you will get in Python, which you will get in HP, this tomorrow I will tell you which you will get in Java Script, which you will get in purse and I have to say this just today if Any language has to exist in the market so it must be object oriented programming language. If you are today's developer then you have to understand the concept of object oriented programming. Now the era is of object oriented thought. Procedure was the oldest concept Pascal COBOL. Old Language The C Online But No Way Are Talking About The Language Support D Features Of Object Oriented Programming Which Is C++ So If In Any Language With Object Oriented Thought We Are Writing Code Where Your Program Is Divided Into Multiple Classes Rather Give Multiple Function Well we have just talked about one language where the total program is divided into multiple functions and the date is a function oriented approach but when the total program is divided into multiple classes the date is an object oriented programming language and object oriented programming. Meaning, the language that supports these features which I am talking about, now I will tell you each feature one by one in detail because these are the There are concepts, son, which we have to drink in moderation. We will understand these concepts by going into so much detail, but for now, we are only writing their names here because I have to tell you the difference, give procedure, object oriented and object [music] oriented programming language. IT FOLLOWS D BOTTOM UP APPROACH OK OBJECT ORIENTED ON ALWAYS FOLLOWS BOTTOM UP APPROACH YOUR OBJECT ORIENTED When we have to write code then you see when we write code in c++ then we will write class ok dewar give it n class ok in after class we Here we will write function meaning [music] class is any name, suggest your is n class and this class consist of some function so I will always go from bottom to you and discount on date bottom up approach this is called bottom up approach ok what we have done Major difference between process oriented and object oriented object vile object oriented follows bottom up approach procedure oriented language whenever it will follow whatever we talked about it always follows top dr approach ok [music] [music] The program goes from the bottom up to the class and this is a bottom up approach so I hope the concept is clear to you now that if we are talking about a language that it is an object oriented programming language then What will be our thought process for programming and if we are saying that the language is a procedure oriented programming language then what will be our thought process where we will talk about both the thoughts in C plus plus because actually C plus plus is IT. In this object oriented programming, there we will get procedure thought and also object thought, but object oriented programming concept is used in C Plus Plus, so whatever major focus we do, we will do that object oriented thought in C Plus Plus, where we We will talk about implementing these concepts, first again when there is a relation of social aggregation, I have written some of these, okay, so we have talked about procedure in object oriented programming language, but there is a language in between these two which is called Object Based Programming Language Okay now sir which language is object oriented so now I told you Java Python C Plus Plus HP Ruby Ruby on Rails Devar is this N language ok tomorrow ok Swift Python this R D Lets of language Java Script this saree The language is to write code with the object oriented thought, but we talked about C, we talked about Pascal, we talked about Komal, we talked about it which is a procedure oriented language, right, so now you see a small concept, what are we talking about, object. Oriented which supports all these features. Listened carefully, which also has inheritance, which now has fields, which has volumes, classes, objects, this is an object oriented right, this is object oriented programming language but if I say object oriented programming. Define in another way Object Oriented Programming Listen carefully Object Oriented Programming is equal to you [Music] Pay attention [Music] [Music] Which one will it be if it is speaking Object Oriented is the one which supports all the features This is the one which features supported by We have also given a definition of object oriented programming and object oriented programming that object oriented programming means object based plus inheritance, so object oriented means which supports all the features and my children which have other features except inheritance, where class is Where there were only objects, then what is not inheritance? This is an object based programming language, where you will get polymer, where you will get headings, where you will get classes, you will get objects, but what you will not get, inheritance, what is this property, this is a matter of fact but Whatever language is your Object Based Programming Language G Language Don't Have Inheritance Concept [Music] Vishal Basic Is An Object Based Programming Language It Is Not Object Oriented Programming Language And It Was Brought In Object Oriented Form With A New Language Named vb.net So there is a difference between V and vb.net, there is a difference between normal basic and visual basic.net, the version which is Vision Basic Six Point Zero is still an object based programming language but later on when this language was updated. So This language no it is object oriented but d name it is visual basic.net ok so this region is the same vb.net by d difference between V and vb.net in Microsoft if we want to read dot net platform then there we talk about this difference. Let's talk about c++ now, but if we get knowledge from the story then we should take it. Have you ever asked this question in an interview? Difference between object based on object oriented programming language, at least there this lecture will be useful for us. So, I hope you are understanding these concepts, so let us revise a little bit that what we were going to discuss today, the process of what we talked about is being object oriented and object oriented. What is the difference based on it and where does C++ stand in it? So on the first step we talked about procedure oriented where I told you that language in which program is divided into multiple functions models and data are function right so this is function oriented and procedure oriented programming language. In which we read that it follows this it is D top dr up note this one sorry this is in the key of classes and object [music] after but when we talk about c++ then it is boat name of Approach, then we talked about that language where object oriented features are supported, where your entire program is divided into multiple classes and this is what object oriented. Before this, what we talked about was procedure oriented, function oriented from the language where the complete program is. This divided into multiple classes is okay, so we said object oriented programming and this is what bottom up approach, why bottom up approach because where I will be at the last and rest of the classes will be at the top, then we talked about object oriented means D language support. Which talks about these features of solution, absolute data, heading in IT and many other things, date is an object oriented programming language but in between procedure oriented and object oriented, Dewar is a language where except inheritance, all other languages ​​are supported and date is what . Object Based Programming Language [Music] [Music] Perfect So this is what we talked about the concept of procedure oriented object oriented object based what is the difference and in all these we talked about different languages ​​C plus plus is meli object oriented But yes it support both procedure and object oriented concept so this also we do if we talk about top most language then C it is n procedure oriented ok C plus plus both procedure and object oriented ok Java object oriented ok Python again both procedure and Object , which language has been kept in which category, I hope you have understood the concept, which feature is supported in which language, so we also talked about the difference, I hope you have understood this important lecture and If you liked the video, then please share it with your friends and stay tuned because in the future we are going to talk about many important concepts. Our next lecture will be on Features of Object Oriented Programming which is the most important concept which is We have talked about object oriented programming, what is the meaning of object oriented programming and what are these features which we have just discussed, so let's meet in the next lecture and till then stay happy, keep smiling, don't worry, okay so let's do. Let's meet till we take care bye [Music]"},{video_id:"14BL_FwQCpM",title:"Fastest Way to Learn ANY Programming Language: 80-20 rule",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14BL_FwQCpM",duration:504,transcript:`This is how I learned to code in Python, Javascript

which was Java, I spent months watching online tutorials and following along. But when I joined Amazon, I delivered a project
in Python within the first 2 weeks. I had never written a single line of code
in Python before working on this project. Later when I joined Google, I used the same
approach to quickly pick up C++ and be useful to my team. And I have done this over and over again to
learn other languages like JavaScript, Go and Dart. But, how am I able to do all this? Did I take some magic pill that made me a
Python wiz overnight? Truth be told, it’s actually very simple. For thousands of years, great civilizations
and powerful leaders have tried to uncover the secrets of learning a new programming
language. To find the answer, we have to go all the
way back to 1945. World War 2 has just ended and after winning
the war, the British want to spread English throughout the world. As you might already know, English is not
exactly a very easy language to learn as a non-native speaker. So, they created this simplified version of
English called Basic English. Basic English had only 850 words. For comparison, there are around 170,000 total
words in English. In addition to fewer words, Basic English
also had simplified grammar rules, with a focus on basic sentence structures. To popularize the language, the British used
state owned radio called British Broadcasting Corporation or BBC to create a show named
“English by Radio ''. This show taught Basic English vocabulary and pronunciation to non-native
speakers and was a huge success. But how could just 850 words and a few basic
grammar constructs help people learn English? And can we use the same principles to learn
a new programming language? To answer that, we need to know a few things
about how the languages exactly work. Imagine a circle that contains the top 10%
most popular words among the 170,000 total words in English. This circle would contain words like I, me,
you, eat, drink etc. Then we have another circle around it that
contains the next 20% most popular words. This would contain words like overpaid and
programmer which makes sense. And we can keep making these circles until
we cover all 170,000 words. In case you are curious, the outermost circle
contains words like nincompoop and teetotaler. For simplicity, let’s combine the innermost
two circles together and the rest of the circles together. Now imagine that you start reading one of
the best novels of our times called “Fifty Shades of Grey” which has a total of 150,000
words. What you’ll find is that roughly 80% of
these 150,000 words in the book lie in the inner circle and the rest of the 20% words
come from the outer circle. For those who don’t know, this is also known
as Pareto principle. Pareto principle states that 20% of your effort
results in 80% of your outcomes. And this powerful principle is the main idea
behind the BASIC English as well as the secret to learning a new programming language really
fast. I applied the same principle to learn French
and now, “Je peux parler en français mais mon accent est marrant”. “Learning a new spoken language is one thing
but learning a language that a computer understands is totally different”, you might say. Well, let’s try to test this hypothesis. Let’s build the same circles for the vocabulary
of programming languages. What would be the top 10% most popular concepts
here? I believe it would include different data
types like int, float, strings or Array etc. Maybe “if else” blocks and for loops would
also be part of this circle. Maybe writing functions and classes would
also be here. If you move outside to the next circle, you
might have concepts like polymorphism and inheritance etc. And you can keep drawing these circles until
you reach the outermost circle that might have I don’t know, maybe iterators or generators. Now if you pick all the Github repos in the
language of your choice, you will find that 80% of the code would be coming from the inner
20% circle. And following what we learnt from the BASIC
English example, we will focus on this 20% circle first. But as we do this, we need to be careful about
2 things. Number one, this 20% circle though fairly
similar might vary a little bit across different languages. For example, in Java, you might have an Arraylist
and you will call it just List in Python. Or in Javascript, you might have async/await
which might be very different in other languages. The point is, this top 20% circle might change
depending on the language you pick. So, you would want to do your own research
on the top concepts for the language of your choice. Number two, when you are trying to learn these
concepts, you need to change your method of learning. If you were trying to learn a new spoken language,
let’s French for example. No matter how many movies or TV series you
watch in French, you will not be able to speak French unless you actually try to talk in
French. In the same way, no matter how many lectures
or video tutorials you watch in Javascript, you will not be able to code in Javascript
unless you actually try to code in Javascript. In a video tutorial, you will usually get
the code that already works and if you copy it, sure enough, it will work for you as well. But, programming is the art of breaking and
fixing things. That’s why I recommend interactive learning
instead of casual learning. For example, if you want to learn Python,
you can go to learnpython.org and do exercises, break things and fix them as you learn new
concepts. Similarly, for Javascript, you can use W3
schools. I am sure you can find this kind of platform
in other languages as well. Now that you know what to learn and how to
learn it, there are 2 problems left for us to solve. How to remember what we are learning and How
to learn the rest of 80% concepts in the circle. To solve the first problem, we need to first
understand the Ebbinghaus Forgetting curve. Herman Ebbinghaus was a German psychologist
who is well known for his work on memory and learning. He conducted experiments where he would give
himself some nonsense words to remember and then test himself at various intervals to
see how many of these words he could remember. What he found became the backbone of how we
teach kids in the modern school system. What you are seeing is the famous Ebbinghaus
Forgetting curve. This graph is a classical exponential decay
graph. What this means is that right after we learn
something new, we start forgetting it very quickly. But this rate of forgetting slows down over
time and in the end, we only retain a small fraction of what we learnt. But what if I tell you that there is a way
to retain more of what we learnt. Ebbinghaus also studied the impact of revision
on our retention. What he found was that if you review the concepts
again, you can increase the number of words you remember in the end. And if you repeat this multiple times, your
retention can keep increasing. And this is called Spaced Repetition, which
many of you might have already heard about. This is the reason why if you try to learn
a new language using an app like Duolingo, they keep repeating the same words again and
again in the exercises. But how do we apply the spaced repetition
to learning a new programming language? The answer to this question is also the answer
to the second problem that we still need to solve. So, let’s quickly cover the second problem
and then we will talk about the solution. The other pending problem we have is that
we have still not figured out how to learn the remaining 80% of concepts. For this, we need to take a breadth first
approach to our learning. What this means is that instead of taking
some random long deep path from the inner circle to the outside boundary, we just keep
enlarging our inner circle. In other words, we slowly keep increasing
the breadth of our knowledge. The biggest advantage of doing this is that
we are only learning new things that are close to what we already know and this makes learning
them very easy. But how exactly do we do this? To remember more of what we have learnt so
far and to learn the remaining 80% concepts, all we need to do is build projects. But not just any projects, we need projects
with increasing difficulty. I will tell you which exact projects to build
in a moment. But, building projects helps you in 2 ways. Number one, as you build projects, you will
encounter the top 20% concepts again and again. And this will help you achieve spaced repetition. Number two, as you build projects, you will
need to learn some new concepts on the go. If you choose your projects carefully and
slowly increase the difficulty, you can constantly expand your inner circle to become the same
size as the outer circle. One thing that you should be aware of though
is that you will never be able to learn 100% of what there is to learn. But look at you. You don’t know everything about the language
that you speak and you are doing just fine. So, don’t obsess over learning everything. As I mentioned, choosing the right projects
is extremely important. Doing this will not only help you learn faster,
it will provide you with a portfolio of projects that you can write on your resume to impress
the hiring managers. If you want to know about the 5 projects that
I recommend to all beginners, you can watch this video. My name is Sahil and I will see you in the
next one.`},{video_id:"mDgx3yTtvtg",title:"Should you Learn C or C++ First before learning Python Programming

musings with software engineers uh sure surabc hello sir is it necessary to learn cc plus to learn python no you can learn python as an independent programming language c c plus plus python java all these are basic programming languages you can learn programming using any of these programming languages okay the basic programming languages like okay how does the the if conditions work how does the loops work how do you write a function how do you call a function all these particular things are possible within all the programming languages okay so when you're learning basic python you can start directly with python and then learn everything about python later on so it is not necessary to learn i learned my first so my first programming language was of course c because c was there in college and then i also joined a programming institute to learn c okay but after that in 1997 just because before i started my software company i went to a place called ncst i don't know if they are still there ncsc was a was institute called national competence in software technology this was an institute that was run by the government and in that they used to have an exam all over india from that they used to select students okay in that i learned programming on on pascal programming language so the way of teaching programming was using pascal programming language in which we learned programming and data structures and algorithm everything in pascal programming language but the same thing after i after i finished learning programming in pascal when i started actually developing application in visual basic i used the same logic that i was learning in pascal for data structures and algorithm and i use the same logic in visual basic programming okay so you can learn any basic programming language so everyone thank you very much for attending this live spread the word around for this channel these lives are happening three hours long i'm trying to bring as much information as possible with every lines and see you on the next live on thursday 9 5 pm thank you very much"},{video_id:"pTB0EiLXUC8",title:"Object-Oriented Programming, Simplified",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTB0EiLXUC8",duration:454,transcript:"[Music] a popular interview question concerns the four core concepts in object-oriented programming this concepts are encapsulation abstraction inheritance and polymorphism let's look at each of these concepts before object-oriented programming we had procedure of programming that divided a program into a set of functions so we have data stored in a bunch of variables and functions that operate on the data this style of programming is very simple and straightforward often it's what you learn as part of your first programming subject at a university but as your programs grow it will end up with a bunch of functions that are all over the place you might find yourself copying and pasting lines of code over and over you make a change to one function and then several other functions break that's what we call spaghetti code there is so much interdependence e between all these functions it becomes problematic object-oriented programming came to solve this problem in object-oriented programming we combine a group of related variables and functions into a unit we call that unit an object we refer to these variables as properties and the functions as methods here's an example think of a car a car is an object with properties such as make model and color and methods like start stop and move now you might say what marche we don't have cars in our programs give me a real programming example ok think of the local storage object in your browser's every browser has a local storage object that allows you to store data locally this local storage object has a property like length which returns the number of objects in the storage and metals like set item and remove item so in object-oriented programming we group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects and this is what we call encapsulation let me show you an example of this in action so here we have three variables base salary over time and rate below these we have a function to calculate the wage for an employee we refer to this kind of implementation as procedural so we have variables on one side and functions on the other side they're hard decoupled now let's take a look at the object-oriented way to solve this problem we can have an employee object with three properties a salary over time and rate and a method called get wage now why is this better well first of all look at the get wage function this function has no parameters in contrast in a procedural example our get wage function has three parameters the reason in this implementation we don't have any parameters is because all these parameters are actually modeled as properties of this object all these properties and the get wage function they are highly related so they are part of one unit so one of the symptoms of procedural code is functions with so many parameters when you write code in an object-oriented way your functions end up having fewer and fewer parameters as Uncle Bob says the best functions are those with no parameters the fewer the number of parameters the easier it is to use and maintain that function so that's encapsulation now let's look at abstraction think of a DVD player as an object this DVD player has a complex logic board on the inside and a few buttons on the outside that you interact with you simply press the play button and you don't care what happens on the inside all that complexity is hidden from you this is abstraction in practice we can use the same technique in our objects so we can hide some of the properties and methods from the outside and this gives us a couple of benefits first is that we'll make the interface of those objects simpler using an understanding an object with a few properties and methods is easier than an object with several properties and methods the second benefit is that it helps us reduce the impact of change let's imagine that tomorrow we change these inner or private methods these changes will leak to the outside because we don't have any code that touches these methods outside of their containing object we may delete a method or change its parameters but none of these changes will impact the rest of the applications code so with abstraction we reduce the impact of change now the third core concept in object-oriented programming inheritance inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to eliminate redundant code here's an example think of HTML elements like text boxes drop-down lists checkboxes and so on all these elements have a few things in common they should have properties like hidden and inner HTML and metals like click and focus instead of redefining all these properties and methods for every type of HTML element we can define them once in a generic object call it HTML element and have other objects inherit these properties and methods so inheritance helps us eliminate redundant code and finally polymorphism poly means many more means form so polymorphism means many forms in object-oriented programming polymorphism is a technique that allows you to get rid of long ethanol's or switch and case statements so back to our HTML elements example all these objects should have the ability to be rendered on a page but the way each element is rendered is different from the others if you want to render multiple HTML elements in a procedural way our code would probably look like this but with object orientation we can implement a render method in each of these objects and the render method will behave differently depending on the type of the object you're referencing so we can get rid of this nasty switch and case and use one line of code like this you will see that later in the course so here are the benefits of object oriented programming using encapsulation we group related variables and functions together and this way we can reduce complexity now we can reuse this object and do from parts of a program or in different programs with abstraction we hide the details and the complexity and show only the essentials this technique reduces complexity and also isolates the impact of changes in the code with inheritance we can eliminate redundant code and with polymorphism we can refactor ugly switch case statements well hello it's me mash again I wanted to say thank you very much

you will learn about understand what artificial intelligence AI is difference between human and machine intelligence AI applications in different areas branches advantages and disadvantages of AI so without any waiting let's explore this in interesting chapter and dive into a very adventurous World understanding artificial intelligence AI this is our first topic imagine if you had a robot friend who could play your favorite games with you help you finish your homework and even chat with you just like a real person this might sound like something out of a science fiction movie but thanks to something called artificial intelligence or AI it's actually possible artificial intelligence AI is a special kind of technology that allows machines like computers robots and even smartphones to think and learn in ways similar to humans just like how you learn new things every day whether it's solving a tricky math problem or learning how to ride a bicycle AI helps machines learn from their experiences this means that over time these machines can get better at tasks recognize patterns and even make decisions on their own now we will discuss that how artificial intelligence AI Works AI operates by learning from data large data sets teach machines how to make decisions or recognize patterns for instance AI might analyze thousands of pictures of cats to know what a cat looks like once it learns from the data it can identify a cat in a new picture let's discuss about key features of artificial intelligence AI learning AI systems can improve their performance over time through learning from data reasoning AI can make decisions based on available information similar to human reasoning problem solving AI can solve complex Problems by analyzing patterns and drawing conclusions perception AI systems can interpret and understand data from their surroundings like recognizing objects in an image or understanding speech for example have you ever asked your smartphone's Voice Assistant like Siri or Google Assistant to play your favorite song when you do that AI will work behind the scenes it helps The Voice Assistant understand your request and find the song you want to hear this is just one of the many ways AI makes our lives easier and more fun AI is becoming more more and more common in the world around us from the apps on your phone to the smart devices in your home AI is a big part of Modern Life helping to make things more convenient and enjoyable as you learn more about AI you'll discover how powerful and fascinating this technology is definition artificial intelligence AI is when computers or machines can think and learn like humans helping them perform tasks like recognizing images understanding language and making decisions need for artificial intelligence AI artificial intelligence is increasingly necessary because it can handle tasks that are difficult timec consuming or even impossible for humans to perform manually here are some critical reasons for the growing need for AI automation AI can automate repetitive tasks allowing humans to focus on more complex and creative work work for example factories use AI powered robots to assemble products reducing the need for manual labor handling Big Data AI can quickly process vast amounts of data this is particularly useful in fields like healthcare where AI can analyze medical records to detect patterns that might go unnoticed by human doctors improving decision making AI helps in making better decisions by analyzing data and predicting outcomes for example AI helps businesses decide what products to sell by analyzing customer preferences and market trends increased efficiency and speed AI can complete tasks more quickly and with fewer errors than humans for instance AI processes thousands of transactions per second in banking to detect fraudulent activity makes life easier AI makes everyday tasks more manageable by helping us find information quickly giving reminders or suggesting what we might like just like an intelligent assistant assists in difficult jobs AI can perform tasks that are too difficult or dangerous for humans like exploring deep oceans or outer space making it invaluable in Risky situations solves big problems AI helps solve complicated Problems by quickly analyzing large amounts of data which is especially useful in fields like health care for diagnosing diseases learns from experience AI improves by learning from its experiences much like how we improve at something with practice this ability to learn makes AI increasingly effective at what it does example imagine visiting a website and needing help finding something or tracking your order instead of waiting for a person to reply a friendly AI powered chat bot will help you instantly you can ask the chatbot any question like when will my package arrive and it will check the information and give you an answer right away it works 24/7 so the chatbot is always ready to help even if you ask at night amazingly this chat bot can talk to many people simultaneously answering questions for hundreds of users without getting tired it can also understand different languages so people from all over the world can get help quickly by taking care of simple tasks AI chat Bots allow human workers to focus on more complicated issues ensuring everything runs smoothly and efficiently human and machine intelligence human intelligence human intelligence is a natural ability to think learn and solve problems it helps us understand the world make decisions and act with others humans can also feel emotions be creative and generate new ideas for example you're using your intelligence to decide what to wear based on the weather you also use your intelligence to learn new things like how to ride a bike or solve a math problem machine Intelligence on the other hand machine intelligence is the ability of machines like computers and robots to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence however machines do this differently they don't have emotions or creativity like humans do instead they follow instructions given to them by humans these instructions are called algorithms which are like step-by-step guides machines use data to learn and get better at tasks over time but they do this by processing information quickly and following the rules set by their programming now we will learn about the difference between human and machine intelligence you can see the table [Music] here applications of artificial intelligence AI artificial intelligence AI is not just a concept it's something we use daily often without even realizing it here are some simple examples of how AI is used in the real world Healthcare AI helps doctors diagnose diseases by analyzing medical images predicting patient outcomes and suggesting treatment options AI can even assist in surgeries guiding surgeons with precise datadriven insights Etc education AI tools help teachers create personalized learning experiences for students AI powered platforms can track student progress and suggest lessons tailored to the students needs Transportation AI is used in self-driving cars to detect obstacles follow traffic rules and navigate roads AI also helps manage Traffic Systems in smart cities reducing congestion and improving Road Safety customer service AI powered chatbots provide real-time customer support on websites these chat Bots can answer common questions solve problems and help customers make purchases entertainment streaming platforms like Netflix and YouTube use AI algorithms to recommend content based on users viewing habits AI also creates music writes stories and and even paints fun fact AI helped create the famous portrait of edmon d bami a machine generated painting that sold for over $400,000 branches of artificial intelligence AI artificial intelligence is a vast field and it is divided into several branches each focusing on a different aspect of making machines more intelligent let's explore the main branches of AI machine learning ml machine learning is an AI that allows computers to learn from data and improve over time without being programmed for every specific task computers study data learn from it and make decisions based on it example if you use a streaming service like Netflix the app recommends movies or shows based on what you've watched previously this is machine learning in action natural language processing NLP n LP helps machines understand and communicate in human language this allows computers to read listen and even respond to our speech or text allowing us to talk to machines like others example when you ask Alexa or Google Assistant to play your favorite song they understand your request through NLP and respond accordingly robotics AI is used in robots to help them perform physical tasks robots can be programed to assemble products explore dangerous areas or even assist in surgeries example robots are used in factories to assemble cars or Electronics doing tasks that are too repetitive or risky for humans computer vision computer vision allows AI to see by interpreting and understanding images or videos AI recognizes objects faces or even handwritten text using this branch examp example face recognition in smartphones uses computer vision to unlock the phone by recognizing the user's face deep learning deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks designed to mimic the human brain it helps AI understand complex data and perform speech and image recognition tasks example AI that can identify pictures of animals or even diagnose diseases from x-rays uses deep learning to learn from thousand of examples advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence AI advantages of artificial intelligence ai ai brings many benefits to our world here are some of the key advantages efficiency and speed AI can process large amounts of data much faster than humans it can handle repetitive tasks quickly and without getting tired which increases productivity and reduces errors example AI systems and Banks can process thousands of transactions per second checking for fraud and managing accounts faster than a human could 24/7 availability unlike humans AI systems don't need to sleep or take breaks this means AI can work around the clock offering Services anytime people need them example customer service chat Bots provide help at any hour of the day ensuring customers always get the support they need even late at night accuracy and precision AI reduces the chance of human errors in tasks it can perform calculations and analyze data more accurately than humans especially with large data sets example AI can assist doctors in healthare by analyzing medical images and detecting diseases with high accuracy sometimes better than the human eye learning and Improvement through machine learning AI systems improve over time as they learn from new data making them more useful the longer they are used example Voice Assistant like Siri or Alexa improve as they learn how you speak and your preferences making their responses more personalized handling complex tasks AI can analyze and solve complex Problems by processing vast amounts of data this is useful in areas like scientific research where AI helps solve challenging problems humans alone can't handle example AI is used in climate science to analyze weather patterns and predict future climate changes disadvantages of AI while AI offers many advantages there are also some drawbacks to using it here are some key disadvantages lack of emotions AI cannot feel emotions or understand human feelings this limits use in areas where empathy or emotional understanding is needed such as counseling or teaching example a robot or AI system can't comfort someone feeling sad like a human could high cost creating and maintaining AI systems can be expensive it requires a lot of resources to develop AI software collect and manage data and ensure that the systems are working correctly example building a self-driving car requires advanced technology sensors and robust AI software making it costly dependence on data AI relies heavily on data the AI system can make wrong decisions if the data used to train the AI is biased incomplete or inaccurate AI needs high quality data to perform well example if an AI system is trained on bass data it might make unfair decisions like like favoring one group of people in the hiring process job displacement as AI systems take over specific tasks there is a concern that they could replace human jobs especially in manufacturing customer service and data processing example AI powered robots and factories might replace workers who use to assemble products manually ethical and privacy concerns AI systems often require large amounts of data including personal information this raises privacy concerns about how that data is collected and used there are also ethical concerns about AI decision- making in law enforcement or medicine example facial recognition systems used in public places can raise privacy issues if people are being watched without consent [Music]"},{video_id:"LSBQ3nY7H1o",title:"CBSE Artificial Intelligence Class 7 Chapter 1 Sub topic Explanation

the house a customized cup of coffee makes your day easier doesn't it these are the products of artificial intelligence but why use the term artificial intelligence well these machines are artificially incorporated with human-like intelligence to perform tasks as we do this intelligence is built using complex algorithms and mathematical functions but ai may not be as obvious as in the previous examples in fact ai is used in smartphones cars social media feeds video games banking surveillance and many other aspects of our daily life the real question is what does an ai do at its core here is a robot we built in our lab which is now dropped onto a field in spite of a variation in lighting landscape and dimensions of the field the ai robot must perform as expected this ability to react appropriately to a new situation is called generalized learning the robot is now at a crossroad one that is paved and the other rocky the robot must determine which path to take based on the circumstances this portrays the robot's reasoning ability after a short stroll the robot now encounters a stream that it cannot swim across using the plank provided as an input the robot is able to cross this stream so our robot uses the given input and finds the solution for a problem this is problem solving these three capabilities make the robot artificially intelligent in short ai provides machines with the capability to adapt reason and provide solutions well now that we know what ai is let's have a look at the two broad categories an ais classified into weak ai also called narrow ai focuses solely on one task for example alphago is a maestro of the game go but you can't expect it to be even remotely good at chess this makes alphago a weak ai you might say alexa is definitely not a weak ai since it can perform multiple tasks well that's not really true when you ask alexa to play despacito it picks up the keywords play and despacito and runs a program and is trained to alexa cannot respond to a question it isn't trained to answer for instance try asking alexa the status of traffic from work to home alexa cannot provide you this information as she is not trained to and that brings us to our second category of ai strong ai now this is much like the robots that only exist in fiction as of now ultron from avengers is an ideal example of a strong ai that's because it's self-aware and eventually even develops emotions this makes the ai's response unpredictable you must be wondering well how is artificial intelligence different from machine learning and deep learning we saw what ai is machine learning is a technique to achieve ai and deep learning in turn is a subset of machine learning machine learning provides a machine with the capability to learn from data and experience through algorithms deep learning does this learning through ways inspired by the human brain this means through deep learning data and patterns can be better perceived ray kurzweil a well-known futurist predicts that by the year 2045 we would have robots as smart as humans this is called the point of singularity well that's not all in fact elon musk predicts that the human mind and body will be enhanced by ai implants which would make us partly cyborgs so here's a question for you which of the below ai projects don't exist yet a an ai robot with citizenship b a robot with a muscular skeletal system c ai that can read its owner's emotions d ain't that develops emotions over time give it a thought and leave your answers in the comment section below three lucky winners will receive amazon gift vouchers since the human brain is still a mystery it's no surprise that ai2 has a lot of unventured domains for now ai is built to work with humans and make our tasks easier

I'm a 5-year-old yeah sure so imagine you have a toy robot okay so at first when you show it different pictures of animals like cats and dogs it can't figure out which is a catten which is a dog but then once you start telling it multiple times that this is a cat and this is a dog it will start getting smart because it starts to remember okay okay and then one fin day if you show an entirely different picture of a cat a new picture of a cat or dog it will try to guess it correctly so similarly machine learning is a process where you train a robot with multiple examples with so many examples that after a certain point it will start you know it will start guessing right answers oh okay that's a perfect example thank you"},{video_id:"TK4qLwTye_s",title:"Computers Teach Themselves

million YouTube videos but for the first experiment we'll just pick out one frame from each video and uh so you sort of know what YouTube looks like we're going to feed in all those images and then we're going to ask it to represent the world and so what happens well this is YouTube so there will be cats and what I have here is a representation of two of the top level features so the images come in they're compressed they're uh we build up representations of uh what's in all the images and then at the top level some representations come out these basis functions these features that are representing the world and the one on the uh the left here uh is sensitive to cats so these are the images that most excite this node in the network the best matches to that node in the network and the other one is a bunch of faces on the right and then there's uh you know tens of thousands of these nodes and each one picks out a different subset of the images that it matches best so one way to represent what is this feature is to say this one's cats and this one's people although we never gave it the words cats and people it's able to pick those out we can also ask this uh feature this neuron or node in the network work uh what would be the best possible picture that you would be uh most excited about and uh by process of mathematical optimization we can come up with that picture and here they are and maybe it's a little bit hard to see here but uh that looks like a cat pretty much and that definitely looks like a face so the system just by observing the world without being told anything has invented these Concepts uh and I could show you uh a u a complex Journal paper and so on but actually this web comic explained it better than anything else so go look that one up now I should say we call these things neural networks but they aren't really uh brains in any ways uh some of it is motivated by things that we know about the brain so the fact that there's these local receptive Fields uh that there's columns that feed forward we do this process of local contrast normalization so pictures that have different lighting are kind of normalized uh but we're not trying to duplicate what's going on in the brain we're just sort of motivated by it and this is a from a different set of inputs not YouTube im images is a standard set of uh 16 million images and they were all clustered together and these are the types of things that come out so you can see some of what the system is doing is picking out textures like small circles some of what it's doing is picking out uh lines like uh diagonal lines uh shapes like circles but also higher level Concepts like like flowers and ducks and zebras and wine bottles and pizza and so on so it's doing a very good job of

Learn",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo",duration:535,transcript:`On the internet, the algorithms are all around you. You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you (among others) to click, which you did, and the algorithm took note. When you open the TweetBook, A the algorithm decides what you see. When you search through your photos, A the algorithm does the finding. Maybe even makes a little movie for you. When you buy something, A the algorithm sets the price and A the algorithm is at your bank watching transactions for fraud. The stock market is full of algorithms trading with algorithms. Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work, especially when they don't. In Ye Olden Days, humans built algorithmic bots by giving them instructions the humans could explain. "If this, then that." But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions for. There's a gazillion financial transactions a second, which ones are fraudulent? There's octillion videos on NetMeTube. Which eight should the user see as recommendations? Which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all? For this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now? Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions. Not perfect answers,
but much better than a human could do. But how these bots work exactly,
more and more, no one knows. Not even the humans who built them, or "built them", as we will see... Now companies that use these bots
don't want to talk about how they work because the bots are valuable employees. Very, VERY valuable. And how their brains are built is a fiercely guarded trade secret. Right now the cutting edge is most likely very 'I hope you like linear algebra', but what the current hotness is on any particular site and how the bots work, 
is a bit "I dunno", and always will be. So let's talk about one of the more quaint but understandable ways bots CAN be "built" without understanding how their brains work. Say you want a bot that can recognize
what is in a picture. Is it a bee, or is it a three? It's easy for humans (even little humans), but it's impossible to just tell a bot 
in bot language how to do it, because really we just know 
that's a bee and that's a three. We can say in words what makes them different, 
but bots don't understand words. And it's the wiring in our brains 
that makes it happen anyway. While an individual neuron may be understood, and clusters of neurons' general purpose vaguely grasped, the whole is beyond. Nonetheless, it works. So to get a bot that can do this sorting, you don't build it yourself. You build a bot that builds bots,
and a bot that teaches bots. These bots' brains are simpler,
something a smart human programmer can make. The builder bot builds bots, 
though it's not very good at it. At first it connects the wires and modules in the bot brains almost at random. This leads to some very... "special" student bots sent to teacher bot to teach. Of course, teacher bot can't
tell a bee from a three either; if the human could build teacher bot to do that, 
well, then, problem solved. Instead the human gives teacher bot a bunch of "bee" photos, and "three" photos, and an answer key to which is what. Teacher bot can't teach, but teacher bot can TEST. The adorkable student bots stick out their tongues, try very hard, but they are bad at what they do. Very, VERY, bad. And it's not their fault, really, 
they were built that way. Grades in hand, the student bots take a march of shame back to builder bot. those that did best are put to one side, the others recycled. Builder bot still isn't good at building bots, but now it takes those left
and makes copies with changes in new combinations. Back to school they go. Teacher bot teaches - er, tests again, and builder bot builds again. And again, and again. Now a builder that builds at random, 
and a teacher that doesn't teach, just tests, and students who can't learn, they just are what they are, in theory shouldn't work, but in practice, it does. Partly because in every iteration, builder bot's slaughterhouse keeps the best and discards the rest, and partly because teacher bot isn't overseeing an old-timey, one-room schoolhouse with a dozen students, but an infinite warehouse with thousands of students. The test isn't ten questions, but a million questions. And how many times does the test, build, test loop repeat? As many as necessary. At first students that survive are just lucky, but by combining enough lucky bots, and keeping only what works, and randomly messing around with new copies of that eventually a student bot emerges that isn't lucky, that can perhaps barely tell bees from threes. As this bot is copied and changed,
slowly the average test score rises, and thus the grade needed to survive the next round gets higher and higher. Keep this up and eventually from the infinite warehouse (slaughterhouse) a student bot will emerge, who can tell a bee from a three in a photo it's never seen before pretty well. But how the student bot does this, neither the teacher bot nor the builder bot, nor the human overseer, can understand. Nor the student bot itself. After keeping so many useful random changes,
the wiring in its head is incredibly complicated, and while an individual line of code may be understood, and clusters of code's general purpose vaguely grasped, the whole is beyond, nonetheless, it works. But this is frustrating, especially as the student bot is very good at exactly only the kinds of questions it's been taught to. It's great with photos, but useless with videos or baffled if the photos are upside down, or things that are obviously not bees, it's confident are. Since teacher bot can't teach, all the human overseer can do is give it more questions, to make the test even longer, to include the kinds of questions the best bots get wrong. This is important to understand. It's a reason why companies are 
obsessed with collecting data. More data equals longer tests equals better bots. So when you get the "Are you human?" test on a website, you are not only proving that you are human, 
(hopefully), but you are also helping to build the test to make bots that can read, or count, or tell lakes from mountains, or horses from humans. Seeing lots of questions about driving lately? Hmm...! What could that be building a test for? Now figuring out what's in a photo, or on a sign, or filtering videos, requires humans to make correct enough tests. But there is another kind of test that makes itself. Tests ON the humans. For example, say entirely hypothetical NetMeTube wanted users to keep watching as long as possible? Well, how long a user stays on the site is easy to measure. So, teacher bot gives each student bot a bunch of NetMeTube users to oversee, the student bots watch what their user watches, looks at their files, and do their best to pick the videos
that keep the user on the site. The longer the average, the higher their test score. Build, test, repeat. A million cycles later, there's a student bot who's pretty good at keeping the users watching, at least compared to what a human could build. But when people ask:
"How does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos?" Once again, there isn't a great answer other than pointing to the bot, and the user data it had access to, and most vitally, how the human overseers 
direct teacher bot to score the test. That's what the bot is trying to be good at to survive. But what the bot is thinking, or how it thinks it,
is not really knowable. All that's knowable is this student bot
gets to be the algorithm, because it's point one percent better than the previous bot at the test the humans designed. So everywhere on the internet, behind the scenes,
there are tests to increase user interaction, or set prices just right to maximize revenue, or pick the posts from all your friends you'll like the most, or articles people will share the most, or whatever. If it's testable, it's teachable. Well, "teachable", and a student bot will graduate from the warehouse 
to be the algorithm of its domain. At least, for a little while. We're used to the idea that the tools we use, even if we don't understand them, someone does, but with our machines that learn we are increasingly in a position where we use tools, or are used by tools, that no one, not even their creators, understand. We can only hope to guide them with the tests we make, and we need to get comfortable with that, as our algorithmic bot buddies are all around, 
and not going anywhere. OK. The bots are watching. You know what's coming. This is where I need to ask you... To like... comment... ...and subscribe. And bell me. And share on the TweetBook. The algorithm is watching. It won't show people the video... unless you do this. Look what you've reduced me to, bots. What do you want? Do you want watch time? Is that what you want? Fine. (sigh...) Hey guys, did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to? Maybe even just in the background while you're tidying up your all room for hours? Or whatever? There's hours of audio entertainment for you, 
and watch time for the bots overseeing your actions. Go ahead and - and take a click.
Entertain yourself. Help me.

Simplilearn",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzFI9rgwfU",duration:472,transcript:"we know humans learn from their past experiences and machines follow instructions given by humans but what if humans can train the machines to learn from the past data and do what humans can do and much faster well that's called machine learning but it's a lot more than just learning it's also about understanding and reasoning so today we will learn about the basics of machine learning so that's paul he loves listening to new songs he either likes them or dislikes them paul decides this on the basis of the song's tempo genre intensity and the gender of voice for simplicity let's just use tempo and intensity for now so here tempo is on the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast whereas intensity is on the y axis ranging from light to soaring we see that paul likes the song with fast tempo and soaring intensity while he dislikes the song with relaxed tempo and light intensity so now we know paul's choices let's say paul listens to a new song let's name it as song a song a has fast tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies somewhere here looking at the data can you guess whether paul will like the song or not correct so paul likes this song by looking at paul's past choices we were able to classify the unknown song very easily right let's say now paul listens to a new song let's label it as song b so song b lies somewhere here with medium tempo and medium intensity neither relaxed nor fast neither light nor soaring now can you guess whether paul likes it or not not able to guess whether paul will like it or dislike it are the choices unclear correct we could easily classify song a but when the choice became complicated as in the case of song b yes and that's where machine learning comes in let's see how in the same example for song b if we draw a circle around the song b we see that there are four votes for like whereas one would for dislike if we go for the majority votes we can say that paul will definitely like the song that's all this was a basic machine learning algorithm also it's called k nearest neighbors so this is just a small example in one of the many machine learning algorithms quite easy right believe me it is but what happens when the choices become complicated as in the case of song b that's when machine learning comes in it learns the data builds the prediction model and when the new data point comes in it can easily predict for it more the data better the model higher will be the accuracy there are many ways in which the machine learns it could be either supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning let's first quickly understand supervised learning suppose your friend gives you one million coins of three different currencies say one rupee one euro and one dirham each coin has different weights for example a coin of one rupee weighs three grams one euro weighs seven grams and one dirham weighs four grams your model will predict the currency of the coin here your weight becomes the feature of coins while currency becomes the label when you feed this data to the machine learning model it learns which feature is associated with which label for example it will learn that if a coin is of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin let's give a new coin to the machine on the basis of the weight of the new coin your model will predict the currency hence supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model here the machine knew the features of the object and also the labels associated with those features on this note let's move to unsupervised learning and see the difference suppose you have cricket data set of various players with their respective scores and wickets taken when you feed this data set to the machine the machine identifies the pattern of player performance so it plots this data with the respective wickets on the x-axis while runs on the y-axis while looking at the data you'll clearly see that there are two clusters the one cluster are the players who scored higher runs and took less wickets while the other cluster is of the players who scored less runs but took many wickets so here we interpret these two clusters as batsmen and bowlers the important point to note here is that there were no labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the learning with unlabeled data is unsupervised learning so we saw supervised learning where the data was labeled and the unsupervised learning where the data was unlabeled and then there is reinforcement learning which is a reward based learning or we can say that it works on the principle of feedback here let's say you provide the system with an image of a dog and ask it to identify it the system identifies it as a cat so you give a negative feedback to the machine saying that it's a dog's image the machine will learn from the feedback and finally if it comes across any other image of a dog it will be able to classify it correctly that is reinforcement learning to generalize machine learning model let's see a flowchart input is given to a machine learning model which then gives the output according to the algorithm applied if it's right we take the output as a final result else we provide feedback to the training model and ask it to predict until it learns i hope you've understood supervised and unsupervised learning so let's have a quick quiz you have to determine whether the given scenarios uses supervised or unsupervised learning simple right scenario one facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs scenario 2 netflix recommends new movies based on someone's past movie choices scenario 3 analyzing bank data for suspicious transactions and flagging the fraud transactions think wisely and comment below your answers moving on don't you sometimes wonder how is machine learning possible in today's era well that's because today we have humongous data available everybody is online either making a transaction or just surfing the internet and that's generating a huge amount of data every minute and that data my friend is the key to analysis also the memory handling capabilities of computers have largely increased which helps them to process such huge amount of data at hand without any delay and yes computers now have great computational powers so there are a lot of applications of machine learning out there to name a few machine learning is used in healthcare where diagnostics are predicted for doctor's review the sentiment analysis that the tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting application of machine learning fraud detection in the finance sector and also to predict customer churn in the e-commerce sector while booking a gap you must have encountered surge pricing often where it says the fair of your trip has been updated continue booking yes please i'm getting late for office well that's an interesting machine learning model which is used by global taxi giant uber and others where they have differential pricing in real time based on demand the number of cars available bad weather rush r etc so they use the surge pricing model to ensure that those who need a cab can get one also it uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with the goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing can be minimized great hey siri can you remind me to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll remind you thanks no problem comment below some interesting everyday examples around you where machines are learning and doing amazing jobs so that's all for machine learning basics today from my site keep watching this space for more interesting videos until then happy

Tutorial",url:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL3KyYurkSk",duration:698,transcript:"[Music] so broadly let us now try to understand what are the different types of techniques in a machine learning machine learning techniques can be categorized under two main heads one is called supervised learning and second is called unsupervised learning supona supervised learning is a machine learning task of finding a function from a labeled data what is a label data I have got a data set which has got many active use many variables for example I have got data of my customers customer ID age gender occupation their transaction behavior attributes and I have one more additional information saying whether the customer is has churned or not children this column which says which customer has churned and which customer has not churned is called the labeled data this kind of data when I analyze to understand the profile of customers who have churned we have enough profile of customers who haven't not churned I use a technique which will fall under the head supervised learning the labeled class column can also be called as your dependent variable and this class when I analyze with respect to variables like age gender occupation and they passed a buying behavior those variables are called independent variables let's now see what is unsupervised learning unsupervised learning is a machine learning task of exploring the data to derive some inferences or insight from a data the same data which we talked about where I had data of my customers age gender occupation and a class which is whether the customer has churned or not churn if I remove this column I assume that this column whether the customer has churned or not journal if that column is not present in my data set and if I analyze the data in that case this analysis will fall under the head unsupervised learning so in unsupervised learning I will be doing analysis to find out what are the different types of customer segments that I have or what are the types of attributes which are similar between various customers all those things would go under the head of unsupervised learning so broadly speaking if you have a target variable or a labeled class column and then you are doing an analysis in that case it will be a supervised learning if you do not have a labeled class column and you are doing analysis it will go under the head unsupervised learning let us now try to understand supervised learning at in slightly greater length in the supervised learning when you have a data set there will be input attributes called independent variables and there will be a labeled class column which is your target variable or the desired output now you are trying analyze the data wherein you are trying to establish a relationship between your labeled class and the independent input variables feature variables so to analyze this you pass this dataset through a learning algorithm which will be a supervised learning algorithm the supervised learning algorithm will try to find patterns and relationship between the input attributes independent variables and the dependent labelled class based upon the relationships it identifies it is going to give you a model and that model we call a predictive model I am based on the predictive model it is also going to predict the output of those set of records and this is called a supervised learning process to check the model performance what we can do is we can compare the output which is predicted with respect to our desired output and based upon how accurate we make prediction we can have various model performance measures this is what a supervised learning algorithm is all about two main classifications of supervised learning techniques one is a classification and second is regression classification comes when when we are trying to predict the output which is say Class A versus Class me when the output prediction is about a class which record will fall under which head for example credit-card transactions I want to predict whether a credit-card transaction is a for you length transaction or are not fraudulent connection in that case it comes a classification problem regression when my target variable is a continuous variable for example I want to predict the amount a customer is going to spend on a credit card based upon his past purchase patterns and if I'm trying to make a prediction about the Spence the customer is going to make in the next month it will be a continuous target variable in that case we'll call it as a regression process so supervised learning techniques two main broad classifications two broad classic categorization supervised learning techniques are classification or a regression technique now let us come to unsupervised learning technique in unsupervised learning technique as I already mentioned we do not have a labeled class we have a input data and we are trying to analyze things with respect to the given set of input data and this set of data when we analyze using some unsupervised learning technique there are three main classifications one is called a dimension reduction technique for example when I have got data and I am trying to reduce the number of variables in data in that case I call it as a dimension reduction technique some of the dimension reduction techniques most used are principal component analysis factor analysis now when the same data when I am trying to reduce the number of records number of cases that supervised learning technique unsupervised learning technique we call clustering and there is a third type of unsupervised learning technique which is called Association analysis Association analysis example market basket analysis in a market basket analysis what we try to see what are the different products what are the different items the customer buys together this kind of Association analysis is very commonly used by ecommerce for recommendation engine you buy up certain product on an e-commerce portal and the website automatically suggests you what is the Associated product that many other consumers have purchased along with it that is called Association analysis in unsupervised learning technique we directly get a output if you compare a supervised learning versus unsupervised learning let's go back to a supervised learning slate in an unsupervised learning you see we had an input attribute and we had desired label class the algorithm tries to find a relationship between the target variable and independent variables and based upon that it builds a model which is a predictive model and you get a predicted output I can save this predictive model and I can use this predictive model for future prediction about new set of Records that I get for these new set of records my customers I can apply the predictive model and predict their lightly future behavior whereas in an unsupervised learning I have an input data I pass it through unsupervised learning I get a compute that output I can directly use for my own understanding of of some other technique which is likely to follow consequently but there is no model of model in this case I cannot use I do not get a model which can can apply on future records that I am going to get so that is the main difference one of the differences between supervised learning and unsupervised [Music]"},{video_id:"KyGFVrcuMZM",title:"The Different Types of Machine Learning

learning techniques that you need to know now there's so many different ways of doing machine learning and artificial intelligence but these are kind of the four main methods and you need to understand what these methods are so you can appropriately pick the right one for whatever project you're working on it's one thing to go through tutorials and to watch other people apply specific algorithms to specific projects but to actually be able to pick which algorithm that you're gonna use for your own project is its own skill and hopefully this video will help you do that so without further ado we're gonna have a quick word from our sponsor and then we'll get right into it before we get started I would like to thank simply learn for sponsoring this video and giving you all 10%

US dollars worth of IBM cloud credits access to IBM cloud platforms such as IBM Watson and digital badges from IBM you can check it out at the link in the description so I want to make it clear distinction just to start the video here on what I mean by machine learning a lot of people confuse artificial intelligence and machine learning and to be honest with you the internet does not make this easy to kind of distinguish between a lot of people will label their stuff as machine learning when really you know it's a different artificial intelligence strain or they'll say AI and it's not Mitch if people get really confused so let's clear it up right now machine learning is a strain of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is kind of the top tier and everything kind of trickles down from there where machine learning is its own kind of topic within artificial intelligence you can have other things like evolutionary algorithms or you could have different kind of AI algorithms that do specific things that are in their own little bubble machine learning is one of its own bubbles that strains from artificial intelligence now the topics I'm gonna be talking about here in the methods are kind of strains off of machine learning so the different types of machine learning they're not necessarily algorithms there's algorithms that are involved with these methods but they're kind of their own strain and different algorithms will fit into that so with that being said let's talk about the first algorithm which is reinforcement learning now reinforcement learning is a very popular method for training AIS to play video games and that's kind of the example I'm gonna use to explain how this works now reinforcement learning is learning by trial and error and essentially what that means is our AI starts off being extremely stupid having no idea what to do it's seen no prior data before and doesn't know what the level looks like it doesn't know anything and it starts taking random actions so this is where I'm gonna introduce to us three concepts an agent and environment and a reward now our agent is gonna be our artificial intelligence and in this case when we're talking about a game it would be the player of the game or whatever AI you're trying to train our environment is gonna be if we're talking about a game maybe the level in which this agent is playing but in other situations your environment is kind of what you're exploring and what you're trying to optimize or do the best in and then we have a reward and the reward is what our agent is trying to maximize the agent is going to be navigating the environment and based on the actions it takes it's going to be given a reward that reward will come you know from the programmer they will determine what reward the agent gets at what specific scenario for doing what specific action and essentially the goal of the agent is maximize this roar so it starts navigating the level kind of figuring out what it needs to do in navigating the environment and as it does this it starts to realize based on the actions it takes which actions maximize the reward so if we're talking about maybe a Mario game for example Mario will start off maybe running left so going out of the level and it will be given a negative reward and told don't do that stop doing that so the next time this happens it's gonna go the other direction because it says well I know left is bad that minimizes my reward so where can I go to maximize it so don't start going right and then maybe it hits an obstacle it's gonna back okay so when I get to that point rather than hitting the obstacle which gives me a negative reward let's go around the obstacle let's do something that gives me a positive reward and this is the basic premise of reinforcement learning and now on to our next topic which is supervised machine learning now a lot of people to classify this as kind of the most basic and most boring form of machine learning and I would agree but that also makes it one of the most useful now a lot of people that get into machine learning think that you need to use very advanced MA to use neural networks and crazy evolutionary things to solve problems when in reality a lot of the problems that you have can actually be solved with supervised machine learning models now what is supervised machine learning well you start in supervised machine learning with some previous knowledge or some previous data that is step one you're not going to be doing supervised machine learning unless you have some data to work with and what you're going to be doing is essentially trying to come up with some function that can map the input of your data to the output of your data the reason you want to do this is because you have all this previous data and you want to come up with some kind of correlations between them so you want to say hey maybe if a student has high grades that would relate with them studying for a long amount of hours so what you're gonna do is say okay we handled this previous data we're gonna feed it into this machine learning algorithm and it's gonna come up with this function and your goal is with this function that when you pass it some input data that it's never seen before so some data that you're trying to make a prediction for it can give you an accurate prediction for that specific value so that's why you need a lot of data usually to make this work well so what you're gonna do is feed you know the input of this data into the model it's gonna look at it it's gonna spit out some output it's gonna compare that output to what the output should be and then say okay I need to make a tweak here or tune here to make this function a little bit better and this is why it's called a supervised machine learning algorithm because you can almost think of it as like a teacher teaching the model what to do and how to get better where it starts not being very good but as it sees more and more data the teachers like know do that do that you need to fix that tweak that it gets better better better better until you reach a point where you're satisfied with the accuracy of your model and that is supervised machine learning and the next topic to talk about is unsupervised machine learning so in supervised machine learning what we had was some input data and he actually had the answer to that input Deb so we had for example all this information about a student and maybe we're trying to predict their final grade we actually had a bunch of previous students final grades so when we ran through the model we could tell the model when it got something wrong hey you were you know one grade point off from what this grade actually should be based on your current state so let's tune you a bit let's fix you a bit and let's get better unsupervised machine learning we don't actually have the answers to our data we have a ton of different data and we actually don't know what kind of the answer is for what we're looking for the problem itself is slightly undefined and what we're trying to actually do with unsupervised machine learning is have the computer or the algorithm come up with some correlations between our data that we can't see ourselves so maybe we're trying to predict you know something with supervised machine learning we want to figure out what a grades gonna be we want to cluster this information together we want to classify something and we actually know the correct answer whereas here we want to come up with things about our data that we don't know so this is where we talk about something called clustering now I think I made a mistake and I mentioned clustering with supervised machine learning that is not correct clustering typically is gonna be an unsupervised machine learning in a common algorithm in unsupervised machine learning is k-means clustering where maybe we feed a bunch of data points so we only have input data we feed a ton of data points to our model or algorithm and what it does is actually clusters and figures out which data points are related together so maybe we're trying to figure out what you know information will relate someone to be a part of a specific ethnic group or something like that we're looking at some big data well we don't know how many groups we might have in our data how they might be we don't want to specify those so we just pass this information into the computer it does some of this magic stuff with the unsupervised machine learning algorithm and spits back to us a bunch of different clusters of this group and when we pass in a new data point that we haven't seen before well what it does is say okay you are a part of this cluster or you are a part of this group so unsupervised machine learning algorithms are typically used to try to figure out stuff about the data we're trying to determine different groups or different kind of pieces of information and some abstract correlations that we maybe can't see ourself as a programmer or as someone that's analyzing the information a final reminder that if you're interested in becoming an expert in data science to consider the simply learned data science masters course it's comprised of six full courses including our programming data science with Python machine learning tableau desktop qualified associate training Big Data Hadoop spark developer and data science capstone and has three electives such as IBM Watson for chatbots machine learning with our data science with sass now during this course should work on 15 plus real-life projects and learned 30 plus in-demand skills with lifetime access to all of the course content this course is listed at $1,300 which is as low as 115 dollars a month and you can use the discount code data with Tim for a limited time at 10% discount I would personally recommend this course and encourage you guys to take advantage of this offer and now to talk about deep learning now deep learning is by far one of the most kind of looked up to and just like advanced parts of machine learning now a lot of people that get into machine learning just immediately jump into deep learning they see all these neural network things on YouTube they see neural network neural network neural network and they start just learning it and doing it and this was great and you can do this but deep learning is really not applicable to a lot of different tasks or maybe it is but it's way overkill and you could solve a lot of the same tasks that people are doing with deep learning and neural networks which is basic supervised machine learning algorithms or reinforcement learning are simple you know very basic things to setup and to work with so what is deep learning well I've kind of said it already but it's pretty much just working within their own networks now the reason we call this deep is because a neural network has more than one layer so whereas in our other algorithms we kind of just had an input and an output and we had a function that kind of classified or did something with that with a neural network we have layers so we have an input layer we have some hidden layers in the middle we have an output layer and our data actually gets passed through all of these different layers to pick out specific high-level features of it now this is why neural networks are used a lot for classification tasks related to things that have patterns in them so for example doing object detection or image recognition a classic example is going to be with the amnestied data set what essentially you're hoping a neural network is gonna do when you train it on a data set like an amnesty data set which essentially is a bunch of handwritten digits and you want to figure out if there's zeros or if they're ones 2 through 9 is you're gonna pass all the pixels of this image in and then the network's actually gonna look at these pixels try to pick out like lines and features and curves and edges of it and and what the number is based on seeing all those different features that it's kind of created and and figured out so neural networks are really good at looking at higher dimensional features that you can't specifically see in the data set or that actually don't exist it will create those features for you based on the input that you're giving it but this means that it's very complicated it's very complex you don't usually understand how you're actually solving the problem when you're using a neural network because you kind of just give some input you get an output and you don't have any idea what happens in between and that's the dangerous thing when you run into an issue where your neural networks not performing correctly it's very difficult to tweak it and modify it and a lot of the times there's not much you can do because you really just don't understand what's happening in the middle so this has been kind of the four main topics in machine learning now I always like to say that I am no expert there's a lot that I still need to learn I'm a student myself and this stuff is really interesting to me and that's why I go out of my way to make videos like this and to teach other people because I want them to be able to learn the same things that I've done I find a lot of people on the internet what they do is explain things super complicated and just try to make it seem like they're very smart that's really not how I want to come off I want to explain this to you guys as simply as possible so that you can you know go out there and learn it yourself a lot of this stuff is really not that hard it's just you have to have a little bit of knowledge and know where to look to find the information so with that being said that has been the video if you guys learn something you'd like this and you want more content like this please leave a like on the video leave a comment down below and subscribe to the channel

a steady demand for efficiency has created the perfect storm for engineered innovation yet you should not be intimidated by robots though robots are certainly complicated pieces of machinery they are also delightfully simple to understand in a lot of cases robots are based on us humans you can even build your own simple robot at home but before you can go off and make your own you should understand a robot's workings first defining a robot can be tricky as it tends to be used as a blanket term to describe any machine that can perform work or other actions normally performed by humans either automatically or by remote control on the most basic level there are five major human organ systems that have a corollary in robotics a skeletal structure a muscle system to move the skeleton a sensory system that receives information about the body and the surrounding environment a power source to activate the muscles and sensors and finally a brain that processes sensory information and tells the muscles what to do many types of robots also include these systems first you have the controller of the robot which could also be called the brain of the robot a computer program usually runs this and it gives the robot detailed commands to follow secondly you have mechanical parts these can include the motors pistons grippers wheels and gears and help the robot move grab turn and lift they are usually powered by air water or electricity robots also have sensors that help them determine sizes shapes space between objects and direction and finally robots have a power source all of these components work together to control how a robot operates throughout the history of robotics each of these components has improved vastly robots have been a long-standing trope in science fiction however by the 1960s they were actually becoming a reality the first real effort to build an autonomous machine that could move reason and act in its environment was the robot shaky brought to life in 1966 shaky is considered to be the world's first robot to embody artificial intelligence shaky could perceive its surroundings logically deduce implicit facts from explicit ones make a plan to achieve a goal monitor the execution of a plan in the real world and even correct its own errors shaky marked a new era in the age of robotics and computer science some of the algorithms used in robots and ai today have directly descended from shaky the area of robotics has evolved at breakneck speeds companies like boston dynamics are leading the charge creating robots that can almost move
